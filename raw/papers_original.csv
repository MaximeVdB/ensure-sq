Quality requirements (QRs) are important in this regard; however, detailed studies on how companies applying agile methods to manage QRs are limited, as are studies on the rationale for choosing specific QR management practices and related challenges. The aim of this study was to address why practitioners manage QRs as they do and what challenges they face. We also analyzed how existing practices mitigate some of the found challenges. Lastly, we connect the contextual elements of the companies with their practices and challenges. We conducted 36 interviews with practitioners from four companies of varying sizes. Since each company operates in different domains, comparing QR management strategies and related challenges in different contexts was possible. We found that the companies apply proactive, reactive, and interactive strategies to manage QRs. Additionally, our study revealed 40 challenges in six categories that companies applying agile methods may face in QR management. We also identified nine contextual elements that affect QR management practice choices and which, importantly, can explain many related challenges. Based on these findings, we constructed a theoretical model about the connection between context, QR management practices, and challenges. Practitioners in similar contexts can learn from the practices identified in this study. Our preliminary theoretical model can help other practitioners identify what challenges they can expect to face in QR management in different developmental contexts as well as which practices to apply to mitigate these challenges. © 2021, The Author(s)."

Recent studies have shown that test-related factors (e.g., code coverage) can be reliable predictors of software code quality, as measured by post-release defects. While these studies provided initial compelling evidence on the relation between tests and post-release defects, they considered different test-related factors separately: as a consequence, there is still a lack of knowledge of whether these factors are still good predictors when considering all together. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive case study on how test-related factors relate to production code quality in Apache systems. We first investigated how the presence of tests relates to post-release defects; then, we analyzed the role played by the test-related factors previously shown as significantly related to post-release defects. The key findings of the study show that, when controlling for other metrics (e.g., size of the production class), test-related factors have a limited connection to post-release defects. © 2021, The Author(s)."

Acting on the generated warnings, i.e., changing the code indicated in the warning, should be part of, at latest, the code review phase. Despite this being a best practice in software development, there is still a lack of empirical research regarding the usage of ASATs in the wild. In this work, we want to study ASAT warning trends in software via the example of PMD as an ASAT and its usage in open source projects. We analyzed the commit history of 54 projects (with 112,266 commits in total), taking into account 193 PMD rules and 61 PMD releases. We investigate trends of ASAT warnings over up to 17 years for the selected study subjects regarding changes of warning types, short and long term impact of ASAT use, and changes in warning severities. We found that large global changes in ASAT warnings are mostly due to coding style changes regarding braces and naming conventions. We also found that, surprisingly, the influence of the presence of PMD in the build process of the project on warning removal trends for the number of warnings per lines of code is small and not statistically significant. Regardless, if we consider defect density as a proxy for external quality, we see a positive effect if PMD is present in the build configuration of our study subjects. © 2020, The Author(s)."

Due to the very nature of master data-based applications, it is possible to use data with the highest possible level of quality. MDM can help ensure that some common concerns, like duplicates or inconsistencies, are prevented by sharing a ‘single version of the truth’ throughout the organisation, and, in some cases, allowing collaborative updates to the master data repository. Therefore, assuring the reliability of master data-based applications, would improve the organisation efficiency. This type of application should implement a set of functional requirements covering the basic operation of MDM principles. We propose a solution based on the evaluation and certification of ‘functional suitability’ of MDM applications. As part of our proposal, we inferred a set of functional requirements from parts 100 to 140 of ISO 8000. This set will be used as a reference in the required matching to compute values for each one of the metrics, properties, subcharacteristics and ultimately, functional suitability following a bottom-up procedure. Finally, the paper also describes the application of the evaluation procedure of an existing master data-based application. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."

Many of those chatcommunications contain valuable information, such as code descriptions, good programming practices, and causes of commonerrors/exceptions. However, the nature of chat community contentis transient, as opposed to the archival nature of other developercommunications such as email, bug reports and Q&A forums. As aresult, important information and advice are lost over time. The focus of this dissertation is Extracting Archival Informationfrom Software-Related Chats, specifically to (1) automatically identify conversations that contain archival-quality information, (2)accurately reduce the granularity of the information reported asarchival information, and (3) conduct a case study to investigatehow archival quality information extracted from chats compareto related posts in Q&A forums. Archiving knowledge from developer chats could be used potentially in several applications suchas: creating a new archival mechanism available to a given chatcommunity, augmenting Q&A forums, or facilitating the mining ofspecific information and improving software maintenance tools. © 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)."

Therefore, increase in student enrollment, retention and graduation rate is becoming very important, so is the need for effective teaching in these subjects. Many universities commonly use formal, institutional Student Evaluation of Teaching (SET) systems to measure the teaching effectiveness. After each semester, through SET, students provide feedback and comments for their courses and instructors. However, evaluations are private and only a handful people have access to these. Therefore, these evaluations cannot be utilized to create a common understanding of the students' expectations, perspective, desired characteristics of the courses and instructors. On the other hand, third party online platforms like RateMyProfessor.com (RMP) are public, solicit anonymous student feedback and host tremendous amount of data about the instructors and their courses. These platforms are also popular among students. We mined and analyzed the RMP data for some research questions, e.g.: What are the common characteristics of the popular CS instructors? How different are they for the SE instructors? Are there any examples of special characteristics, tools and techniques popular CS instructors use? We captured and analyzed more than 9,000 students' comments for over 300 CS instructors for the top 20 universities in the U.S. and Canada. The paper contributes by presenting the findings for the research questions and making the data and the scripts available for public use for future research. © 2020 IEEE Computer Society.

The proprietary nature of usage data limited deeper exploration of this subject in the past. Objective: To determine how software faults and software use are related and how, based on that, an accurate quality measure can be designed. Method: Via Google Analytics we measure new users, usage intensity, usage frequency, exceptions, and release date and duration for complex proprietary mobile applications for Android and iOS. We utilize Bayesian Network and Random Forest models to explain the interrelationships and to derive the usage independent release quality measure. To increase external validity, we also investigate the interrelationship among various code complexity measures, usage (downloads), and number of issues for 520 NPM packages. We derived a usage-independent quality measure from these analyses, and applied it on 4430 popular NPM packages to construct timelines for comparing the perceived quality (number of issues) and our derived measure of quality during the lifetime of these packages. Results: We found the number of new users to be the primary factor determining the number of exceptions, and found no direct link between the intensity and frequency of software usage and software faults. Crashes increased with the power of 1.02-1.04 of new user for the Android app and power of 1.6 for the iOS app. Release quality expressed as crashes per user was independent of other usage-related predictors, thus serving as a usage independent measure of software quality. Usage also affected quality in NPM, where downloads were strongly associated with numbers of issues, even after taking the other code complexity measures into consideration. Unlike in mobile case where exceptions per user decrease over time, for 45.8% of the NPM packages the number of issues per download increase. Conclusions: We expect our result and our proposed quality measure will help gauge release quality of a software more accurately and inspire further research in this area. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."

To better understand merge conflicts and their impact we performed an empirical study about the types, frequency, and impact of merge conflicts, where impact is measured in terms of bug fixing commits associated with conflicts. We analyzed 143 open source projects and found that almost 1 in 5 merges cause conflicts. In 75.23% of these cases, a developer needed to reflect on the program logic to resolve it. We also found that the code associated with a merge conflict is twice as likely to have a bug. When the code associated with merge conflicts require manual intervention, the code is 26× more likely to have a bug. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."

Tools like collaborative development environments (CDE) are used to facilitate interaction between members of such teams, with the expectation that social factors around the interaction would facilitate team functioning. In this paper, we first identify typically social characteristics of interaction in a software development team: reachability, connection, association, and clustering. We then examine how these factors relate to the quality of software produced by a team, in terms of the number of defects, through an empirical study of 70+ teams, involving 900+ developers in total, spread across 30+ locations and 19 time-zones, working on 40,000+ units of work in the multi-version development of a major industrial product, spreading across more than five years. After controlling for known factors affecting large scale distributed development such as dependency, system age, developer expertise and experience, geographic dispersion, socio-technical congruence, and the number of files changed, we find statistically significant effects of connection and clustering on software quality. Higher levels of intra-team connection are found to relate to higher defect count, whereas more clustering relates to fewer defects. We examine the implications of these results for individual developers, project managers, and organizations. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC."

What practices do developers actually use to achieve design quality in their day-to-day work and which of these do they find most useful? To discover the extent to which practitioners concern themselves with object-oriented design quality and the approaches used when determining quality in practice, a questionnaire survey of 102 software practitioners, approximately half from the UK and the remainder from elsewhere around the world was used. Individual and peer experience are major contributors to design quality. Classic design guidelines, well-known lower level practices, tools and metrics all can also contribute positively to design quality. There is a potential relationship between testing practices and design quality. Inexperience, time pressures, novel problems, novel technology, and imprecise or changing requirements may have a negative impact on quality. Respondents with most experience are more confident in their design decisions, place more value on reviews by team leads and are more likely to rate design quality as very important. For practitioners, these results identify the techniques and tools that other practitioners find effective. For researchers, the results highlight a need for more work investigating the role of experience in the design process and the contribution experience makes to quality. There is also the potential for more in-depth studies of how practitioners are actually using design guidance, including Clean Code. Lastly, the potential relationship between testing practices and design quality merits further investigation. © 2017, The Author(s)."

Risk assessment, which is a core activity of every risk-based testing process, is often done in an ad hoc manual way. Software quality assessments, based on quality models, already describe the product-related risks of a whole software product and provide objective and automation-supported assessments. But so far, quality models have not been applied for risk assessment and risk-based testing in a systematic way. This article tries to fill this gap and investigates how the information and data of a quality assessment based on the open quality model QuaMoCo can be integrated into risk-based testing. We first present two generic approaches showing how quality assessments based on quality models can be integrated into risk-based testing and then provide the concrete integration on the basis of the open quality model QuaMoCo. Based on five open source products, a case study is performed. Results of the case study show that a risk-based testing strategy outperforms a lines of code-based testing strategy with regard to the number of defects detected. Moreover, a significant positive relationship between the risk coefficient and the associated number of defects was found. © 2016, The Author(s)."

Since measurement of the software process is a challenging task, it is frequently the defects in the software product that are used to measure development quality. By extracting semantic information from defect records, practitioners can investigate and address root causes of software defects to improve development process and product quality. Investigating root causes requires effort for a detailed analysis into the components of the development process that originated the software defects, and is therefore encouraged only at higher maturity levels by most known process improvement models such as Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI). This practice, however, postpones the benefits that root-cause analysis would bring in gaining process awareness to improve the software development process and product quality in emergent organizations or organizations residing at lower maturity levels (MLs). In this article, we present a method for and results from applying root-cause analysis for software defects recorded in a software-intensive project of a CMMI ML3 certified institute. The suggested method combines process enactment data collection and analysis with Orthogonal Defect Classification which is a known technique in defect root-cause analysis. Prior to and after implementing the method in the study, defect attributes were analyzed and compared in order to understand any improvements in development performance and product quality. The results of the comparison indicate that the suggested method was efficient in the effort it required and effective in improving development performance and product quality. Defect triggers have become more active in identifying software defects in the earlier phases of software development, and the cost of quality due to software defects has decreased in consequence. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York."

However, recently many studies have shown that post-deployment end-user reviews provide a wealth of insight into the quality of a software product and how it should evolve and be maintained. For example, end-user reviews help to identify missing features or inform developers about incorrect or unexpected software behavior. We believe that analyzing end-user reviews and utilizing analysis tools are a crucial step towards understanding the complete picture of the quality of a software product, as well as towards reasoning about the evolution history of it. In this paper, we investigate whether both methods correlate with one another. In other words, we explore if there exists a relationship between user satisfaction and the application's internal quality characteristics. To conduct our research, we analyze a total of 46 actual releases of three Android open source software (OSS) applications on the Google Play Store. For each release, we employ multiple static analysis tools to assess several aspects of the application's software quality.

However, most of the research is directed towards developing tools, and little time and effort is spent on testing the software to assure its quality. In testing, a test oracle is used to determine whether a test is passed or failed during testing, and unfortunately, for much of bioinformatics software, the exact expected outcomes are not well defined. Thus, the main challenge associated with conducting systematic testing on bioinformatics software is the oracle problem. Metamorphic testing (MT) is a technique used to test programs that face the oracle problem. MT uses metamorphic relations (MRs) to determine whether a test has passed or failed and specifies how the output should change according to a specific change made to the input. In this work, we use MT to test LingPipe, a tool for processing text using computational linguistics, often used in bioinformatics for bio-entity recognition from biomedical literature. First, we identify a set of MRs for testing any bio-entity recognition program. Then we develop a set of test cases that can be used to test LingPipe's bio-entity recognition functionality using these MRs. To evaluate the effectiveness of this testing process, we automatically generate a set of faulty versions of LingPipe. According to our analysis of the experimental results, we observe that our MRs can detect the majority of these faulty versions, which shows the utility of this testing technique for quality assurance of bioinformatics software. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery."

Since an RTOS4A has safety-critical applications, demonstrating a satisfactory level of its quality to its stakeholders is very important. By assessing the variation in quality across consecutive releases of an industrial RTOS4A based on test data collected over 17 months, we aim to provide a set of guidelines to 1) improve the test effectiveness and thus the quality of subsequent RTOS4A releases and 2) similarly assess the quality of other systems from test data. We carefully defined a set of research questions, for which we defined a number of variables (based on available test data), including release and measures of test effort, test effectiveness, complexity, test efficiency, test strength, and failure density. With these variables, to assess the quality in terms of number of failures found in tests, we applied a combination of analyses, including trend analysis using two-dimensional graphs, correlation analysis using Spearman’s test, and difference analysis using the Wilcoxon rank test. Key results include the following: 1) The number of failures and failure density decreased in the latest releases and the test coverage was either high or did not decrease with each release; 2) increased test effort was spent on modules of greater complexity and the number of failures was not high in these modules; and 3) the test coverage for modules without failures was not lower than the test coverage for modules with failures uncovered in all the releases. The overall assessment, based on the evidences, suggests that the quality of the latest RTOS4A release has improved. We conclude that the quality of the RTOS4A studied was improved in the latest release. In addition, our industrial partner found our guidelines useful and we believe that these guidelines can be used to assess the quality of other applications in the future. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York."

Some companies perceive that their implementation has prohibitive costs, whereas some authors identify in their use a way to comply with software development patterns and standards, produce economic value and lead to corporate performance improvement. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between quality maturity levels and labor productivity, using a data set containing 687 Brazilian software firms. We study here the relationship between labor productivity, as measured through the annual gross revenue per worker ratio, and quality levels, which were appraised from 2006 to 2012 according to two distinct software process improvement models: MPS.BR and CMMI. We perform independent statistical tests using appraisals carried out according to each of these models, consequently obtaining a data set with as many observations as possible, in order to seek strong support for our research. We first show that MPS.BR and CMMI appraised quality maturity levels are correlated, but we find no statistical evidence that they are related to higher labor productivity or productivity growth. On the contrary, we present evidence suggesting that average labor productivity is higher in software companies without appraised quality levels. Moreover, our analyses suggest that companies with appraised quality maturity levels are more or less productive depending on factors such as their business nature, main origin of capital and maintained quality level. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York."

We extend our prior mapping study to investigate the extent to which contextual and methodological details regarding BN construction are reported in the studies. We conduct a systematic literature review on the applications of BNs to predict software quality. We focus on more detailed questions regarding (1) dataset characteristics, (2) techniques used for parameter learning, (3) techniques used for structure learning, (4) use of tools, and (5) model validation techniques. Results on ten primary studies show that BNs are mostly built based on expert knowledge, i.e. structure and prior distributions are defined by experts, whereas authors benefit from BN tools and quantitative data to validate their models. In most of the papers, authors do not clearly explain their justification for choosing a specific technique, and they do not compare their proposed BNs with other machine learning approaches. There is also a lack of consensus on the performance measures to validate the proposed BNs. Compared to other domains, the use of BNs is still very limited and current publications do not report enough details to replicate the studies. We propose a framework that provides a set of guidelines for reporting the essential contextual and methodological details of BNs.

The majority of existing work treats software engineering problems from a single or bi-objective point of view, where the main goal is to maximize or minimize one or two objectives. However, most software engineering problems are naturally complex in which many conflicting objectives need to be optimized. Software refactoring is one of these problems involving finding a compromise between several quality attributes to improve the quality of the system while preserving the behavior. To this end, we propose a novel representation of the refactoring problem as a many-objective one where every quality attribute to improve is considered as an independent objective to be optimized. In our approach based on the recent NSGA-III algorithm, the refactoring solutions are evaluated using a set of 8 distinct objectives. We evaluated this approach on one industrial project and seven open source systems. We compared our findings to: several other many-objective techniques (IBEA, MOEA/D, GrEA, and DBEA-Eps), an existing multi-objective approach a mono-objective technique and an existing refactoring technique not based on heuristic search. Statistical analysis of our experiments over 31 runs shows the efficiency of our approach. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York."

Prior work has shown that formal code inspections tend to improve the quality of delivered software. However, the formal code inspection process mandates strict review criteria (e.g., in-person meetings and reviewer checklists) to ensure a base level of review quality, while the modern, lightweight code reviewing process does not. Although recent work explores the modern code review process, little is known about the relationship between modern code review practices and long-term software quality. Hence, in this paper, we study the relationship between post-release defects (a popular proxy for long-term software quality) and: (1) code review coverage, i.e., the proportion of changes that have been code reviewed, (2) code review participation, i.e., the degree of reviewer involvement in the code review process, and (3) code reviewer expertise, i.e., the level of domain-specific expertise of the code reviewers. Through a case study of the Qt, VTK, and ITK projects, we find that code review coverage, participation, and expertise share a significant link with software quality. Hence, our results empirically confirm the intuition that poorly-reviewed code has a negative impact on software quality in large systems using modern reviewing tools. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York."

Although prior work uncovers a link between code ownership heuristics and software quality, these heuristics rely solely on the authorship of code changes. In addition to authoring code changes, developers also make important contributions to a module by reviewing code changes. Indeed, recent work shows that reviewers are highly active in modern code review processes, often suggesting alternative solutions or providing updates to the code changes. In this paper, we complement traditional code ownership heuristics using code review activity. Through a case study of six releases of the large Qt and OpenStack systems, we find that: (1) 67%-86% of developers did not author any code changes for a module, but still actively contributed by reviewing 21%-39% of the code changes, (2) code ownership heuristics that are aware of reviewing activity share a relationship with software quality, and (3) the proportion of reviewers without expertise shares a strong, increasing relationship with the likelihood of having post-release defects. Our results suggest that reviewing activity captures an important aspect of code ownership, and should be included in approximations of it in future studies. © 2016 ACM."

In this regard, Paretobased search algorithms, e.g., Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II, have already shown good performance for solving multi-objective optimization problems. These algorithms produce Pareto fronts, where each Pareto front consists of a set of nondominated solutions. Eventually, a user selects one or more of the solutions from a Pareto front for their specific problems. A key challenge of applying Pareto-based search algorithms is to select appropriate quality indicators, e.g., hypervolume, to assess the quality of Pareto fronts. Based on the results of an extended literature review, we found that the current literature and practice in SBSE lacks a practical guide for selecting quality indicators despite a large number of published SBSE works. In this direction, the paper presents a practical guide for the SBSE community to select quality indicators for assessing Pareto-based search algorithms in different software engineering contexts. The practical guide is derived from the following complementary theoretical and empirical methods: 1) key theoretical foundations of quality indicators; 2) evidence from an extended literature review; and 3) evidence collected from an extensive experiment that was conducted to evaluate eight quality indicators from four different categories with six Pareto-based search algorithms using three real industrial problems from two diverse domains. © 2016 ACM."

Agreements or disagreements among members of a team may originate from inherent groupings, depending on various professional or other characteristics. These agreements are not easily detected by conventional practices (discussions, meetings, etc.) since the natural language expressions are often obscuring, subjective, and prone to misunderstandings. It is therefore essential to have objective tools that can measure the alignment among the members of a team; especially critical for the software development is the degree of alignment with respect to the prioritization goals of the software product. The paper proposes an experience-based framework of statistical and graphical techniques for the systematic study of prioritization alignment, such as hierarchical cluster analysis, analysis of cluster composition, correlation analysis, and closest agreement-directed graph. This framework can provide a thorough and global picture of a team’s prioritization perspective and can potentially aid managerial decisions regarding team composition and leadership. The framework is applied and illustrated in a study related to global software development where 65 individuals in different roles, geographic locations and professional relationships with a company, prioritize 24 goals from individual perception of the actual situation and for an ideal situation. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York."

However, empirical studies reporting on the magnitude of the effect are scarce. This paper presents findings from an embedded explanatory case study on the change in quality over time, across multiple releases, for products that were developed in a GSD setting. The GSD setting involved periods of distributed development between geographically dispersed sites as well as a handover of project management responsibilities between the involved sites. Investigations were performed on two medium-sized products from a company that is part of a large multinational corporation. Quality is investigated quantitatively using defect data and measures that quantify two source code properties, size and complexity. Observations were triangulated with subjective views from company representatives. There were no observable indications that the distribution of work or handover of project management responsibilities had an impact on quality on both products. Among the product-, process- and people-related success factors, we identified well-designed product architectures, early handover planning and support from the sending site to the receiving site after the handover and skilled employees at the involved sites. Overall, these results can be useful input for decision-makers who are considering distributing development work between globally dispersed sites or handing over project management responsibilities from one site to another. Moreover, our study shows that analyzing the evolution of size and complexity properties of a product’s source code can provide valuable information to support decision-making during similar projects. Finally, the strategy used by the company to relocate responsibilities can also be considered as an alternative for software transfers, which have been linked with a decline in efficiency, productivity and quality. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York."

The main idea of the QCR model is to direct additional investment into software units that have some fault-slip potential in their later verification phases, with the aim of reducing costs and increasing product quality. The fault-slip potential of a software unit within a system is determined by analogy with historical projects. After a preliminary study on a sample of software units, which proves that we can lower quality costs with additional investment into particular verification activities, we examine the effectiveness of the proposed QCR model using real project data. The results show that applying the model produces a positive business case, meaning that the model lowers quality costs and increases quality, resulting in economic benefit. The potential to reduce quality costs is growing significantly with the evolution of software systems and the reuse of their software units. The proposed model is the result of a research project performed at Ericsson. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York."

For example, Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox release new versions every 6 weeks. These shorter release cycles reduce the users’ waiting time for a new release and offer better feedback and marketing opportunities to companies, but it is unclear if the quality of the software product improves as well, since developers and testers are under more pressure. In this paper, we extend our previous empirical study of Mozilla Firefox on the impact of rapid releases on quality assurance with feedback by Mozilla project members. The study compares crash rates, median uptime, and the proportion of pre- and post-release bugs in traditional releases with those in rapid releases, and we also analyze the source code changes made by developers to identify potential changes in the development process. We found that (1) with shorter release cycles, users do not experience significantly more pre- or post-release bugs (percentage-wise) and (2) bugs are fixed faster, yet (3) users experience these bugs earlier during software execution (the program crashes earlier). Increased integration activity and propagation of harder bugs to later versions account for some of these findings. Overall, our case study suggests that a clear release engineering process with thorough automation is one of the major challenges when switching to rapid releases. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York."

Such platforms provide functionalities and abstraction on which applications can be rapidly developed and easily deployed. Hadoop and JBoss are examples of popular open source platform software. Such platform software generate logs to assist operators in monitoring the applications that run on them. These logs capture the doubts, concerns, and needs of developers and operators of platform software. We believe that such logs can be used to better understand code quality. However, logging characteristics and their relation to quality has never been explored. In this paper, we sought to empirically study this relation through a case study on four releases of Hadoop and JBoss. Our findings show that files with logging statements have higher post-release defect densities than those without logging statements in 7 out of 8 studied releases. Inspired by prior studies on code quality, we defined log-related product metrics, such as the number of log lines in a file, and log-related process metrics such as the number of changed log lines. We find that the correlations between our log-related metrics and post-release defects are as strong as their correlations with traditional process metrics, such as the number of pre-release defects, which is known to be one the metrics with the strongest correlation with post-release defects. We also find that log-related metrics can complement traditional product and process metrics resulting in up to 40 % improvement in explanatory power of defect proneness. Our results show that logging characteristics provide strong indicators of defect-prone source code files. However, we note that removing logs is not the answer to better code quality. Instead, our results show that it might be the case that developers often relay their concerns about a piece of code through logs. Hence, code quality improvement efforts (e.g., testing and inspection) should focus more on the source code files with large amounts of logs or with large amounts of log churn. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York."

Their resource constraints require high efficiency in development. Furthermore, quality assurance (QA) measures need to be taken to mitigate the risk of additional, expensive effort for bug fixes or compensations. Automated static analysis (ASA) can reduce this risk because it promises low application effort. SMEs seem to take little advantage of this opportunity. Instead, they still mainly rely on the dynamic analysis approach of software testing. In this article, we report on our experiences from a technology transfer project. Our aim was to evaluate the results static analysis can provide for SMEs as well as the problems that occur when introducing and using static analysis in SMEs. We analysed five software projects from five collaborating SMEs using three different ASA techniques: code clone detection, bug pattern detection and architecture conformance analysis. Following the analysis, we applied a quality model to aggregate and evaluate the results. Our study shows that the effort required to introduce ASA techniques in SMEs is small (mostly below one person-hour each). Furthermore, we encountered only few technical problems. By means of the analyses, we could detect multiple defects in production code. The participating companies perceived the analysis results to be a helpful addition to their current QA and will include the analyses in their QA process. With the help of the Quamoco quality model, we could efficiently aggregate and rate static analysis results. However, we also encountered a partial mismatch with the opinions of the SMEs. We conclude that ASA and quality models can be a valuable and affordable addition to the QA process of SMEs. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013."

The quality attributes of a target product, such as security and performance, are often assessed until the final product is generated. However, it might be very costly to fix the problem if it is found that the generated product cannot satisfy the customers’ quality requirements. Although the quality of a generated product will be affected by all the life cycles of product development, feature-based product configuration is the first stage where the estimation or prediction of the quality attributes should be considered. As we know, the key issue of predicting the quality attributes for a product configured from feature models is to measure the interdependencies between functional features and quality attributes. The current existing approaches have several limitations on this issue, such as requiring real products for the measurement or involving domain experts’ efforts. To overcome these limitations, we propose a systematic approach of modeling quality attributes in feature models based on domain experts’ judgments using the analytic hierarchical process (AHP) and conducting quality aware product configuration based on the captured quality knowledge. Domain experts’ judgments are adapted to avoid generating the real products for quality evaluation, and AHP is used to reduce domain experts’ efforts involved in the judgments. A prototype tool is developed to implement the concepts of the proposed approach, and a formal evaluation is carried out based on a large-scale case study. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York."

For example, in game development, cowboy coders are necessary to cope with the continuous interplay between creative desires and technical constraints. Consequently, game developers are hesitant to use automated testing because of these tests rapid obsolescence in the face of shifting creative desires of game designers.

The framework also provides a quantitative basis for evaluating the extent of value addition that can be achieved while deciding upon whether or not to consider a particular non-functional requirement for inclusion to the project's requirement set. The assessment process also indicates the extent to which different business values are perceived important by representatives of business organizations, and their perception of the importance of the different NFRs.

To address this, we have developed a design assessment method called MIDAS (Method for Intensive Design ASsessments). MIDAS is an expert-based method wherein manual assessment of design quality by experts is directed by the systematic application of design analysis tools through the use of a three view-model consisting of design principles, project-specific constraints, and an 'ility'-based quality model. In this paper, we describe the motivation for MIDAS, its design, and its application to three projects in CT DC AA.

In source code, a significant proportion of vocabulary can be either acronyms and-or abbreviations or concatenation of terms that can not be identified using consistent mechanisms such as naming conventions. It is, therefore, essential to disambiguate concepts conveyed by identifiers to support program comprehension and reap the full benefit of Information Retrieval-based techniques (e.g., feature location and traceability) whose linguistic information (i.e., source code identifiers and comments) used across all software artifacts (e.g., requirements, design, change requests, tests, and source code) must be consistent. To this aim, we propose source code vocabulary normalization approaches that exploit contextual information to align the vocabulary found in the source code with that found in other software artifacts. We were inspired in the choice of context levels by prior works and by our findings. Normalization consists of two tasks: splitting and expansion of source code identifiers. We also investigate the effect of source code vocabulary normalization approaches on software maintenance tasks. Results of our evaluation show that our contextual-aware techniques are accurate and efficient in terms of computation time than state of the art alternatives. In addition, our findings reveal that feature location techniques can benefit from vocabulary normalization when no dynamic information is available. © 2013 IEEE."

Cognitive biases, which are defined as patterned deviations of human thought from the laws of logic and mathematics, are a likely cause of software defects. However, there is little empirical evidence to date to substantiate this assertion. In this research, we focus on a specific cognitive bias, confirmation bias, which is defined as the tendency of people to seek evidence that verifies a hypothesis rather than seeking evidence to falsify a hypothesis. Due to this confirmation bias, developers tend to perform unit tests to make their program work rather than to break their code. Therefore, confirmation bias is believed to be one of the factors that lead to an increased software defect density. In this research, we present a metric scheme that explores the impact of developers' confirmation bias on software defect density. In order to estimate the effectiveness of our metric scheme in the quantification of confirmation bias within the context of software development, we performed an empirical study that addressed the prediction of the defective parts of software. In our empirical study, we used confirmation bias metrics on five datasets obtained from two companies. Our results provide empirical evidence that human thought processes and cognitive aspects deserve further investigation to improve decision making in software development for effective process management and resource allocation. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC."

To make best use of testing efforts, researchers have studied statistical models to predict in which parts of a software system future defects are likely to occur. By studying the mathematical relations between predictor variables used in these models, researchers can form an increased understanding of the important connections between development activities and software quality. Predictor variables used in past top-performing models are largely based on source code-oriented metrics, such as lines of code or number of changes. However, source code is the end product of numerous interlaced and collaborative activities carried out by developers. Traces of such activities can be found in the various repositories used to manage development efforts. In this paper, we develop statistical models to study the impact of social interactions in a software project on software quality. These models use predictor variables based on social information mined from the issue tracking and version control repositories of two large open-source software projects. The results of our case studies demonstrate the impact of metrics from four different dimensions of social interaction on post-release defects. Our findings show that statistical models based on social information have a similar degree of explanatory power as traditional models. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that social information does not substitute, but rather augments traditional source code-based metrics used in defect prediction models. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC."

In software product lines (SPL), quality is even more important than in a single software product since, owing to systematic reuse, a fault or an inadequate design decision could be propagated to several products in the family. Over the last few years, a great number of quality attributes and measures for assessing the quality of SPL have been reported in literature. However, no studies summarizing the current knowledge about them exist. This paper presents a systematic literature review with the objective of identifying and interpreting all the available studies from 1996 to 2010 that present quality attributes and/or measures for SPL. These attributes and measures have been classified using a set of criteria that includes the life cycle phase in which the measures are applied; the corresponding quality characteristics; their support for specific SPL characteristics (e. g., variability, compositionality); the procedure used to validate the measures, etc. We found 165 measures related to 97 different quality attributes. The results of the review indicated that 92% of the measures evaluate attributes that are related to maintainability. In addition, 67% of the measures are used during the design phase of Domain Engineering, and 56% are applied to evaluate the product line architecture. However, only 25% of them have been empirically validated. In conclusion, the results provide a global vision of the state of the research within this area in order to help researchers in detecting weaknesses, directing research efforts, and identifying new research lines. In particular, there is a need for new measures with which to evaluate both the quality of the artifacts produced during the entire SPL life cycle and other quality characteristics. There is also a need for more validation (both theoretical and empirical) of existing measures. In addition, our results may be useful as a reference guide for practitioners to assist them in the selection or the adaptation of existing measures for evaluating their software product lines. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC."

For this purpose, we have developed a specific strategy called SIQinU (Strategy for understanding and Improving Quality in Use), which allows recognizing problems of quality in use through evaluation and proposes product improvements by understanding and making changes on product attributes. Hence by re-evaluating quality in use of the new version, improvement gains can be gauged. SIQinU is in alignment with GOCAME (Goal-Oriented Context-Aware Measurement and Evaluation), a multi-purpose generic strategy previously developed for measurement and evaluation which relies on: a conceptual framework (with ontological base), a process, and methods and tools. Since the process aspect is paramount in defining SIQinU - given the amount of phases and activities - in this paper we model the functional and behavioral process views illustrating them with excerpts of a real case study. © 2011 ACM."

Approaches, such as code smell detection, have been developed to identify particular kinds of debt, e.g. design debt. What has not yet been understood is the impact design debt has on the quality of a software product. Answering this question is important for understanding how growing debt affects a software product and how it slows down development, e.g. though introducing rework such as fixing bugs. In this case study we investigate how design debt, in the form of god classes, affects the maintainability and correctness of software products by studying two sample applications of a small-size software development company. The results show that god classes are changed more often and contain more defects than non-god classes. This result complements findings of earlier research and suggests that technical debt has a negative impact on software quality, and should therefore be identified and managed closely in the development process. © 2011 ACM."

A major challenge of this optimization problem is that code quality is less visible to stakeholders in the development process, particularly, to the management. In this paper, we describe an approach for automated software analysis and monitoring of both quality-related code metrics and development activities by means of software maps. A software map represents an adaptive, hierarchical representation of software implementation artifacts such as source code files being organized in a modular hierarchy. The maps can express and combine information about software development, software quality, and system dynamics; they can systematically be specified, automatically generated, and organized by templates. The maps aim at supporting decision-making processes. For example, they facilitate to decide where in the code an increase of quality would be beneficial both for speeding up current development activities and for reducing risks of future maintenance problems. Due to their high degree of expressiveness and their instantaneous generation, the maps additionally serve as up-to-date information tools, bridging an essential information gap between management and development, improve awareness, and serve as early risk detection instrument. The software map concept and its tool implementation are evaluated by means of two case studies on large industrially developed software systems. © 2011 ACM."

In practice, architects often analyse the expected performance and reliability of design alternatives based on prototypes or former experience. Model-driven prediction methods claim to uncover the tradeoffs between different alternatives quantitatively while being more cost-effective and less error-prone. However, they often suffer from weak tool support and focus on single quality attributes. Furthermore, there is limited evidence on their effectiveness based on documented industrial case studies. Thus, we have applied a novel, model-driven prediction method called Q-ImPrESS on a large-scale process control system consisting of several million lines of code from the automation domain to evaluate its evolution scenarios. This paper reports our experiences with the method and lessons learned. Benefits of Q-ImPrESS are the good architectural decision support and comprehensive tool framework, while one drawback is the time-consuming data collection. © 2011 ACM."

Our analysis used data from 362 projects of four different firms. These projects spanned a wide range of programming languages, application domain, process choices, and development sites spread over 15 countries and 5 continents. Our analysis revealed fundamental tradeoffs in choosing configurational choices that are optimized for productivity, quality, and/or profits. In particular, achieving higher levels of productivity and quality require diametrically opposed configurational choices. In addition, creating imbalances in the expertise and personnel distribution of project teams significantly helps increase profit margins. However, a profit-oriented imbalance could also significantly affect productivity and/or quality outcomes. Analyzing these complex tradeoffs, we provide actionable managerial insights that can help software firms and their clients choose configurations that achieve desired project outcomes in globally distributed software development. © 2011 ACM."

We outline four guidelines that address these challenges to make prior work on software quality assurance more pragmatic: 1) Focused Granularity (i.e., small prioritization units), 2) Timely Feedback (i.e., results can be acted on in a timely fashion), 3) Estimate Effort (i.e., estimate the time it will take to complete tasks), and 4) Evaluate Generality (i.e., evaluate findings across multiple projects and multiple domains).

On such complex software networks we computed a self-similar coefficient, also known as fractal dimension, using ""the box counting method"". We analyzed various releases of the publically available Eclipse software systems, calculating the fractal dimension for twenty sub-projects, randomly chosen, for every release, as well as for each release as a whole. Our results display an overall consistency among the sub-projects and among all the analyzed releases. We found a very good correlation between the fractal dimension and the number of bugs for Eclipse and for twenty sub-projects. Since the fractal dimension is just a scalar number that characterizes a whole system, while complexity and quality metrics are in general computed on every system module, this result suggests that the fractal dimension could be considered as a global quality metric for large software systems. Our results need however to be confirmed for other large software systems. © 2011 ACM."

In this paper we propose a framework for evaluating quality-driven self-adaptive software systems. Our framework is based on a survey of self-adaptive system papers and a set of adaptation properties derived from control theory properties. We also establish a mapping between these properties and software quality attributes. Thus, corresponding software quality metrics can then be used to assess adaptation properties. © 2011 ACM."

Most software quality models and evaluation processes models assume that software quality may be deterministically evaluated, especially when it is evaluated by experts. Consequently, software developers focus on the technical characteristics of the software product. A similar assumption is common in most engineering disciplines. However, in regard to other kinds of goods, direct violations of the assumption about objective evaluation were shown to be affected by the consequences of cognitive processes limitations. Ongoing discussion in the area of behavioral economics raises the question: are the experts prone to observation biases? If they are, then software quality models overlook an important aspect of software quality evaluation. This article proposes an experiment that aims to trace the influence of users' knowledge on software quality assessment. Measuring the influence of single variables for the software quality perception process is a complex task. There is no valid quality model for the precise measurement of product quality, and consequently software engineering does not have tools to freely manipulate the quality level for a product. This article proposes a simplified method to manipulate the observed quality level, thereby making it possible to conduct research. The proposed experiment has been conducted among professional software evaluators. The results show the significant negative influence (large effect size) of negative experience of users on final opinion about software quality regardless of its actual level. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC."

This has improved the understanding of real-life architectures. However, when multiple stakeholder concerns need to be addressed, they easily become scattered throughout the documentation. One reason might be that architectural views typically don't support the easy evaluation of trade-offs between conflicting quality attributes. When these concerns and related architectural decisions are distributed among many views, they are less obvious to architects and stakeholders. The authors propose an approach to creating architectural views that more prominently communicate the conflicts between key stakeholders' concerns. The approach also tends to reduce the amount of architectural documentation and thus increase its communication value by highlighting architectural decisions made to resolve the conflicts identified. © 2006 IEEE."

They are one of the key methodologies that undergraduates study in order to develop quality software. Despite their importance, reviews are rarely used in software engineering projects at the baccalaureate level. This paper demonstrates results from a study conducted on students at baccalaureate level enrolled in a one-semester software engineering course at the National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences - Foundation for Advancement of Science and Technology (NUCES-FAST) in Pakistan. The objectives of the study are: to determine how the various team review techniques help to educate students about the importance of the review process and find which technique is more suitable for teaching reviews to undergraduates. Two variations on team review are proposed: Similar Domain Review (SDR) and Cross-Domain Review (CDR) without author. The paper presents a comparison of the proposed and existing team review techniques and measures their effectiveness in terms of defect detection. The results show that the proposed variation SDR is more effective in defect detection than CDR (with/without author). Another interesting result is that the proposed CDR-without author is better than CDR with author (the existing team review approach). Also, early defect detection enabled students to incorporate changes and improve the software quality. © 2010 ACM."

Specifically, we analyze six Open Source as well as two Closed Source projects and show that process data quality and characteristics have an impact on the bug fixing process: the high rate of empty commit messages in Eclipse, for example, correlates with the bug report quality.

Due to the fast growing complexity and accompanying risks of failures of these systems, software quality needs to be addressed explicitly by software developers, preferably with a systematic method for an optimal implementation of software qualities, such as reliability, time-behavior and usability. At the Centre of Automation of Mission-critical Systems (CAMS) of the Dutch Royal Navy, a new approach has been defined for software developers to improve the way that they deal with software quality in the process of mission-critical systems engineering. The stepwise approach is based on both an international quality standard for software product quality, i.e. ISO9126, and on Multi-Criteria Decision Making techniques, i.e. analytical hierarchy process (AHP). The stepwise approach has been validated in a case study. In particular, the tailoring of the ISO9126 standard toward the specific CAMS development situation, and the applicability of AHP techniques, from the perspective of software developers, has been investigated. The case study is carried out in a representative software development project, i.e. the software for combat management systems (CMS) of warships. Results of the case study show that software developers can explicitly deal with quality on the basis of both the ISO9126 standard and the AHP techniques, respectively regarding the specification, prioritization and metrication of software product quality. © 2010 The Author(s)."

But despite growing awareness of the importance of achieving cultural alignment between holders of different business and IT groups, little attempt has been made to empirically examine the requirements for software quality held by different groups involved in the development process. We conducted a survey of more than 300 current and recently graduated students of one of the leading Executive MBA programs in the United States, asking them to rate the importance of each of 13 widely-cited attributes related to software quality.

This paper presents the software process data warehousing architecture SPDW+ as a solution to the frequent, seamless, and automated capturing of software quality metrics, and their integration in a central repository for a full range of analyses. The striking features of the SPDW+ ETL (data extraction, transformation, and loading) approach are that it addresses heterogeneity issues related to the software development context, it is automatable and non-intrusive, and it allows different capturing frequency and latency strategies, hence allowing both analysis and monitoring of software metrics. The paper also provides a reference framework that details three orthogonal dimensions for considering ETL issues in the software development process context, used to develop SPDW+ ETL. The advantages of SPDW+ are: (1) flexibility to meet the requirements of the frequent changes in SDP environments; (2) support for monitoring, which implies the execution of frequent and incremental loads; (3) automation of the complex and time-consuming task of capturing metrics, making it seamless; (4) freedom of choice regarding management models and support tools used in projects; and (5) cohesion and consistency of the information stored in the metrics repository which will be used to compare data of different projects. The paper presents the reference framework, illustrates the key role played by the metrics capturing process in a metrics program using a case study, and presents the striking features of SPDW+ and its ETL approach, as well as an evaluation based on a prototype implementation. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC."

Despite successes and standardisation efforts, quality models are still being criticised, as their application in practice exhibits various problems. To some extent, this criticism is caused by an unclear definition of what quality models are and which purposes they serve. Beyond this, there is a lack of explicitly stated requirements for quality models with respect to their intended mode of application. To remedy this, this paper describes purposes and usage scenarios of quality models and, based on the literature and experiences from the authors, collects critique of existing models.

Project failures and the lack of software quality have become a major concern for researchers and practitioners. For many software development projects as well as for many quality assurance departments, teamwork is extremely important. Therefore, nearly all organizations pay attention to teamwork which is essential for smooth operation of a project. It is believed that teamwork is crucial for the success or failure of a project. In addition to the importance of teamwork, team issues affecting its' performance also needs attention. Among these team issues, people issues are scarce in the literature. The research outlined in this paper investigated the factors which influence teamwork. It identified the importance of trust and how trust influences IT project teams and the role of project managers and team leaders in improving trust within teams. It also includes individual behaviors that affect trust within a team. A study of six project managers from two Australian organizations was conducted to investigate the factors which influence teamwork to result in project success and software quality. The results showed that trust is a central element of the many factors and that without trust in the team; teamwork will be negatively affected resulting in project failure and poor quality. © 2009 IEEE."

During their lives, applications undergo lots of changes to add new functionalities or to refactor older ones; these changes tend to reduce the quality of the applications themselves, causing the phenomenon known as software aging. Monitoring of software aging is very important for companies, but up to now there are no standard approaches to perform this task. In addition many of the suggested models assess software aging basing on few software features, whereas this phenomenon affects all of the software aspects. In 2005 ISO/IEC released the SQuaRE quality model which covers several elements of software quality assessment, but some issues make SQuaRE usage quite difficult. The purpose of this paper is to suggest an approach to software aging monitoring that considers the software product in its wholeness and to provide a specialization of the SQuaRE quality model which allows to perform this task. © 2009 IEEE."

However, inspections are often applied with the underlying assumption that they work equally well to assess all kinds of quality attributes of SRS. Little work has yet been done to validate this assumption. At Capgemini sd&m, we set up an inspection technique to assess SRS, the so called ""specification quality gate"" (QG-Spec). The QG-Spec has been applied to a series of large scale commercial projects. In this paper we present our lessons learned and discuss, which quality attributes are effectively assessed by means of the QG-Spec - and which are not. We argue that our results can be generalized to other existing inspection techniques. We came to the conclusion that inspections have to be carefully balanced with techniques for constructive quality assurance in order to economically arrive at high quality SRS. © 2009 IEEE."

Prior literature on distributed development in software engineering and other fields discuss various challenges, including cultural barriers, expertise transfer dif-ficulties, and communication and coordination overhead. We evaluate this conventional belief by examining the overall development of Windows Vista and comparing the postrelease failures of components that were developed in a distributed fashion with those that were developed by collocated teams. We found a negligible difference in failures. This difference becomes even less significant when controlling for the number of developers working on a binary. We also examine component characteristics such as code churn, complexity, dependency information, and test code coverage and find very little difference between distributed and collocated components to investigate if less complex components are more distributed. Further, we examine the software process and phenomena that occurred during the Vista development cycle and present ways in which the development process utilized may be insensitive to geography by mitigating the difficulties introduced in prior work in this area. © 2009 IEEE."

Although the costs of the implementation and appraisal of CMM/CMMI are high for the software providers, there is no formal study investigating whether this investment pays off or, in other words, whether their customers are measurably satisfied with the quality of the service provided. This article presents the results of a formal evaluation of customer perception of the service quality offered by the software providers appraised in CMM/CMMI.

Typically, this fit dataset contains software metrics collected during a past release of the software project that we want to predict the quality of. In order to improve the predictive accuracy of such quality models, it is common practice to combine the predictive results of multiple learners to take advantage of their respective biases. Although multi-learner classifiers have been proven to be successful in some cases, the improvement is not always significant because the information in the fit dataset sometimes can be insufficient. We present an innovative method to build software quality models using majority voting to combine the predictions of multiple learners induced on multiple training datasets. To our knowledge, no previous study in software quality has attempted to take advantage of multiple software project data repositories which are generally spread across the organization. In a large scale empirical study involving seven real-world datasets and seventeen learners, we show that, on average, combining the predictions of one learner trained on multiple datasets significantly improves the predictive performance compared to one learner induced on a single fit dataset. We also demonstrate empirically that combining multiple learners trained on a single training dataset does not significantly improve the average predictive accuracy compared to the use of a single learner induced on a single fit dataset. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC."

For example, maintainability is an external software quality attribute, and it is subjective because interpersonally agreed definitions for the attribute include the phrase 'the ease with which maintenance tasks can be performed'. Subjectivity clearly makes measurement of the attributes and validation of prediction systems for the attributes problematic. In fact, in spite of the definitions, few statistically valid attempts at determining the predictive capability of prediction systems for external quality attributes have been published. When validations have been attempted, one approach used is to ask experts to indicate if the values provided by the prediction system informally agree with the experts' intuition. These attempts are undertaken without determining, independently of the prediction system, whether the experts are capable of direct consistent measurement of the attribute. Hence, a statistically valid and unbiased estimate of the predictive capability of the prediction system cannot be obtained (because the experts' measurement process is not independent of the prediction system's values). In this paper, it is argued that the problem of subjective measurement of quality attributes should not be ignored if quality is to be introduced into software in a controlled way. Further, it is argued that direct measurement of quality attributes should be encouraged and that in fact such measurement can be quantified to establish consistency using an existing approach. However, the approach needs to be made more accessible to promote its use. In so doing, it would be possible to decide whether consistent independent estimates of the true values of software quality attributes can be assigned and prediction systems for quality attributes developed. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC."

Most of this research is focused on the internal/development view of quality. More recent studies have made attempts to understand the stakeholder view of quality. With globalisation, many new challenges affect software quality. Not only do we need to understand the many stakeholder views of quality, we now need to consider the cultural issues, and the outsourcing issues.

Specificity of each suggested model is one of the impediments in development of a generic model. A few models have been quality factor specific whereas others are software development paradigm specific. The models can even be company specific or domain specific. The amount of work done for software quality prediction compels the researchers to get benefit from the existing models and develop a relatively generic model. Development of a generic model will facilitate the quality managers by letting them focus on how to improve the quality instead of employing time on deciding which technique best suites their scenario. This paper suggests a generic model which takes software as input and predicts a quality factor value using existing models. This approach captures the specificity of existing models in various dimensions (like quality factor, software development paradigm, and software development life cycle phase etc.), and calculates quality factor value based on the model with higher accuracy. Application of the model has been discussed with the help of an example. Copyright 2008 ACM."

Unrealistic schedules and budgets, with continuing steams of requirements changes lead to projects with a high risk of failure. There is too often only a vague idea of the required solution at the outset of a project and this makes it difficult for estimators and developers. It is commonly accepted that there will be requirements changes throughout the project. This means that managing changes becomes a challenge. Most IT experts agree that failures occur far more often than they should. Most developments are expensive, with a difficult process affected by a series of problems including poor project management, cost and schedule overruns, poor quality software and under-motivated developers. Unfortunately few project post-mortems are conducted, and little understanding is gained from the results of past projects Most project failures are predictable and avoidable, but many project managers cannot identify what success and failure factors are important, early enough to take action. Many factors are described in the literature including project pressures with project stakeholders impacting the cost and quality of the project, organizational structure, communication with customer/users, and amongst customers, developers & users, stakeholder politics, commercial pressures, poor leadership, lack of upper management support and personality conflicts, unrealistic, unarticulated goals, poor user requirements and requirements specification, customer satisfaction; scheduling, project budget, and inaccurate estimates of resources, poor project management, poor reporting of project status, unmanaged risks, inability to handle project complexity, the project management process and tracking tools, sloppy development practices, software development methodologies, use of immature technology, product quality, business processes and resources. There are generally more than 1 or 2 reasons for a project failure which may be caused by a combination of technical, project management and business decisions. Most organizations do not see preventing failure as an urgent matter. Unfortunately, the literature on project failure is based on handful of failed project case studies. Our research is concerned with getting quantitative evidence on aspects contributing to failure. If we know what factors are responsible for failure we can focus on these factors and improve the quality of our development processes for future projects. We also should recognize effects of project failure on development staff. Late projects usually cause long hours of unpaid overtime, loss of motivation, and stress. This then leads to high staff turnover and its associated costs. This research provides an update on prior studies and tests the validity of previously reported anecdotal evidence about project failure factors. We build on previously reported research but our concern is with everyday projects, not the high profile projects normally reported in the newspapers. We collected a set of project data and teased it out to find the main failure factors for a whole group of projects. We first developed a questionnaire targeting software developers' perceptions of practices affecting project outcomes. Our questionnaire was based on extensive discussions with 90+ software developers as well as the literature. The survey included 88 questions organized into sections covering sponsor/senior management, customer/user, requirements, estimation and scheduling, the development process, the project manager and project management, and the development team. We also asked if the project was a success or a failure. The questionnaire was distributed to practitioners from a large U.S. financial institution where each responded by answering it twice. It was then distributed to various companies in North Eastern U.S.A., a number of different Australian companies; and a number of different Chilean organizations; each respondent in the latter groups answered the questionnaire once. We collected data on 304 projects, 70 were failures. Of the failed projects, 49 were in-house and 21 outsourced, 65 were development projects and 5 maintenance projects. The largest project that failed had 180 developers. We examined the data using frequency analyses and as well investigated relationships between the most important factors."

We consider this a particularly interesting question in the context of initiatives to promote sharing and secondary analysis of data sets. METHOD - we perform a systematic review of available empirical software engineering studies. RESULTS - only 23 out of the many hundreds of studies assessed, explicitly considered data quality. CONCLUSIONS - first, the community needs to consider the quality and appropriateness of the data set being utilised; not all data sets are equal. Second, we need more research into means of identifying, and ideally repairing, noisy cases. Third, it should become routine to use sensitivity analysis to assess conclusion stability with respect to the assumptions that must be made concerning noise levels. Copyright 2008 ACM."

One of the most important goals of such techniques is to accurately predict the modules where faults are likely to hide as early as possible in the development lifecycle. Design, code, and most recently, requirements metrics have been successfully used for predicting fault-prone modules. The goal of this paper is to compare the performance of predictive models which use design-level metrics with those that use code-level metrics and those that use both. We analyze thirteen datasets from NASA Metrics Data Program which offer design as well as code metrics. Using a range of modeling techniques and statistical significance tests, we confirmed that models built from code metrics typically outperform design metrics based models. However, both types of models prove to be useful as they can be constructed in different project phases. Code-based models can be used to increase the performance of design-level models and, thus, increase the efficiency of assigning verification and validation activities late in the development lifecycle. We also conclude that models that utilize a combination of design and code level metrics outperform models which use either one or the other metric set. Copyright 2008 ACM."

The conclusion is that, while large efforts have been devoted to the definition of measurable attributes and related measures, product models specifically developed for measuring quality characteristics are until now not sufficiently explored. We explore the concept of ""quality-oriented specialized product models"" and we claim that this is an important ingredient for an engineering approach to the software quality measurement. We describe an example of this type of models for measuring the security of a specific type of copy protection mechanisms. The model forecasts the amount of time a hypothetical attacker would need to break the protection. Copyright 2008 ACM."

The question was whether the team climate in software developer teams has any relation to software product quality. We define team climate as the shared perceptions of the team's work procedures and practices. The team climate factors examined were West and Anderson's participative safety, support for innovation, team vision and task orientation. These four factors were measured before the project using the Team Selection Inventory (TSI) test to establish subject climate preferences, as well as during and after the project using the Team Climate Inventory (TCI) test, which establishes the subject's perceptions of the climate. In this quasi-experimental study, data were collected from a sample of 35 three-member developer teams in an academic setting. These teams were formed at random and their members were blind to the quasi-experimental conditions and hypotheses. All teams used an adaptation of extreme programming (XP) to the students' environment to develop the same software system. We found that high team vision preferences and high participative safety perceptions of the team were significantly related to better software. Additionally, the results show that there is a positive relationship between the categorization of better than preferred, as preferred and worse than preferred climate and software quality for two of the teamwork climate factors: participative safety and team vision. So it seems important to track team climate in an organization and team as one (of many) indicators of the quality of the software to be delivered. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC."

However, attempts at validating prediction systems for external subjective quality attributes have tended to rely on experts indicating that the values provided by the prediction systems informally agree with the experts' intuition about the attribute. These attempts are undertaken without a pre-defined scale on which it is known that the attribute can be measured consistently. Consequently, a valid unbiased estimate of the predictive capability of the prediction system cannot be given because the experts' measurement process is not independent of the prediction system's values. Usually, no justification is given for not checking to see if the experts can measure the attribute consistently. It seems to be assumed that: subjective measurement isn't proper measurement or subjective measurement cannot be quantified or no one knows the true values of the attributes anyway and they cannot be estimated. However, even though the classification of software systems' or software artefacts' quality attributes is subjective, it is possible to quantify experts' measurements in terms of conditional probabilities. It is then possible, using a statistical approach, to assess formally whether the experts' measurements can be considered consistent. If the measurements are consistent, it is also possible to identify estimates of the true values, which are independent of the prediction system. These values can then be used to assess the predictive capability of the prediction system. In this paper we use Bayesian inference, Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation and missing data imputation to develop statistical tests for consistent measurement of subjective ordinal scale attributes. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC."

The question is, ""How good are the resulting designs?"" Advocates claim that TDD produces code that is simpler, more cohesive, and less coupled than code developed in a more traditional test-last way. Sounds good, but is it true? We collected evidence to substantiate or question the claims regarding TDD's influence on software. We focused on internal software quality that is, design and code characteristics such as code complexity, size, coupling, and cohesion. We conducted three quasicontrolled experiments and one case study in a Fortune 500 company and another two quasicontrolled experiments with university students in undergraduate and graduate software engineering courses. We evaluated 24 student and professional programmers working on 21 software projects ranging in size from a few hundred to over 30,000 lines of code. The results indicate that TDD programmers tend to write software modules that are smaller, less complex, and more highly tested than modules produced by their test-last counterparts. However, the results didn't support claims for lower coupling and increased cohesion with TDD. © 2008 IEEE."

Existing software quality evaluation models examine multiple characteristics and are characterized by factorial fuzziness. The relevant criteria of this model are derived from the international norm ISO. The main objective of this paper is to propose a novel Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) approach for addressing uncertainty and imprecision in service evaluation during pre-negotiation stages, where comparative judgments of decision makers are represented as fuzzy triangular numbers. A new fuzzy prioritization method, which derives crisp priorities from consistent and inconsistent fuzzy comparison matrices, is proposed. The Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP)-based decision-making method can provide decision makers or buyers with a valuable guideline for evaluating software quality. Importantly, the proposed model can aids users and developers in assessing software quality, making it highly applicable for academic and commercial purposes. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC."

Besides well known manual inspection and review techniques more recent approaches utilize tool-based static code for the evaluation of internal software quality. Despite the high potential of static code analyzers the application of tools alone cannot replace well founded expert opinion. Knowledge, experience and fair judgement is indispensable for a valid, reliable quality assessment, which is accepted by software developers and managers. The EMISQ method (Evaluation Method for Internal Software Quality), guides the assessment process for all stakeholders of an evaluation project. The method is supported by a tool that assists evaluators with their analysis and rating tasks and provides support for generating a code quality report. The application of the method in a pilot project has shown its applicability."

Reports of successful software reuse programs in industry have been published. However, there has been little effort to organize the evidence systematically and appraise it. This review aims to assess the effects of software reuse in industrial contexts. Journals and major conferences between 1994 and 2005 were searched to find observational studies and experiments conducted in industry, returning eleven papers of observational type. Systematic software reuse is significantly related to lower problem (defect, fault or error) density in five studies and to decreased effort spent on correcting problems in three studies. The review found evidence for significant gains in apparent productivity in three studies. Other significant benefits of software reuse were reported in single studies or the results were inconsistent. Evidence from industry is sparse and combining results was done by vote-counting. Researchers should pay more attention to using comparable metrics, performing longitudinal studies, and explaining the results and impact on industry. For industry, evaluating reuse of COTS or OSS components, integrating reuse activities in software processes, better data collection and evaluating return on investment are major challenges. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC."

As products and applications mature, users expect higher quality products. They want IT organizations to be responsible and accountable for the quality claims made by the product marketing teams. In the last couple decades, much software engineering research has focussed on standards, methodologies and techniques for improving software quality, measuring software quality and software quality assurance. Most of this research is focused on the internal/development view of quality. More recent studies done in conjunction with the marketing groups have made attempts to understand the customer view of quality.

The quality of data collected from software informs decisions on maintenance, testing and wider issues such as the need for system re-engineering. While of the two types stated, automatic data collection is preferable, there are numerous occasions when manual data collection is unavoidable. Yet, very little evidence exists to assess the error-proneness of the latter. Herein, we investigate the extent to which manual data collection for Java software compared with its automatic counterpart for the same data. We investigate three hypotheses relating to the difference between automated and manual data collection. Five Java systems were used to support our investigation. Results showed that, as expected, manual data collection was error-prone, but nowhere near the extent we had initially envisaged. Key indicators of mistakes in manual data collection were found to be poor developer coding style, poor adherence to sound OO coding principles, and the existence of relatively large classes in some systems. Some interesting results were found relating to the collection of public class features and the types of error made during manual data collection. The study thus offers an insight into some of the typical problems associated with collecting data manually; more significantly, it highlights the problems that poorly written systems have on the quality of visually extracted data. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2007."

A software quality model is typically trained using software measurement and fault data obtained from a previous release or similar project. Such an approach assumes that fault data is available for all the training modules. Various issues in software development may limit the availability of fault-proneness data for all the training modules. Consequently, the available labeled training dataset is such that the trained software quality model may not provide predictions. More specifically, the small set of modules with known fault-proneness labels is not sufficient for capturing the software quality trends of the project. We investigate semi-supervised learning with the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm for software quality estimation with limited fault-proneness data. The hypothesis is that knowledge stored in software attributes of the unlabeled program modules will aid in improving software quality estimation. Software data collected from a large NASA software project is used during the semi-supervised learning process. The software quality model is evaluated with multiple test datasets collected from other NASA software projects. Compared to software quality models trained only with the available set of labeled program modules, the EM-based semi-supervised learning scheme improves generalization performance of the software quality models. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC."

In this paper, we give the results of the contest from the viewpoint of software quality evaluation. We create a framework for evaluating the software quality which integrated design model quality and the final system performance, and conduct analysis using the framework. As a result of analysis, it is found that the quantitative measurement of the structural complexity of the design models bears a strong relationship to qualitative evaluation of the design conducted by judges. It is also found that there is no strong correlation between design model quality evaluated by the judges and the final system performance. For embedded software development, it is particularly important to estimate and verify reliability and performance in the early stages, using the model. Based on the analysis result, we consider possible remedies with respect to the models submitted, the evaluation methods used and the contest specifications. In order to adequately measure several non-functional quality characteristics including performance on the model, it is necessary to improve the way of developing robot software (such as applying model driven development) and reexamine the evaluation methods.

The politics of communication and marketing follows subsequently when these political factors converge, and determine what people hear and how interaction styles affect outcome."

Risk analysis helps address the problem of testing by balancing the risk exposure of doing to little with the risk exposure of doing to much. The focus of the Cocomo II constructive cost model is a mathematical relationship involving 24 variables used to estimate the effort in person-months required to develop a software product. The parameters of this model include the product's equivalent size in thousands of lines of code (KLOC) and personnel characteristics.

They basically form three sides of the same triangle. Beyond a certain point (the ""Quality is Free"" point), it is difficult to increase the quality without increasing either cost or schedule or both for the software under development. As products and applications mature, users expect higher quality products. They want IT organizations to be responsible and accountable for the quality claims made by the product marketing teams. In the last couple decades, much software engineering research has focussed on standards, methodologies and techniques for improving software quality, measuring software quality and software quality assurance. Most of this research is focused on the internal/development view of quality. More recent studies done in conjunction with the marketing groups have made attempts to understand the customer view of quality. All of these different ongoing activities to understand quality from the various perspectives have made the field even more enriching and exciting. The Fourth Workshop on Software Quality aims to bring together academic, industrial and commercial communities interested in software quality topics to discuss the different technologies being defined and used in the software quality area."

However target setting is usually done subjectively in practice, which is not scientific. Two quantitative approaches for setting target values: benchmarking and primitive linear regression have been developed and applied in the past to overcome this problem (Akao and Yoji, 1990). But these approaches cannot be used to assess the impact of unachieved targets on satisfaction of customers for customer requirements. In addition, both of them are based on linear regression and not very practical in many applications. In this paper, we present an innovative quantitative method of setting technical targets in SQFD to enable analysis of impact of unachieved target values on customer satisfaction. It is based on assessment of impact of technical attributes on satisfaction of customer requirements. In addition both linear and non linear regression techniques are utilized in our method, which certainly improves the existing quantitative methods which are based on only linear regression. © Springer Science + Business Media, Inc. 2006."

Service Oriented Architectures (SOAs) using Web Services as an enabling technology are also being discussed widely in the IT press. However, despite the numerous and real advantages of these architectural patterns there are still many software quality challenges that remain unresolved. This is particularly true as we consider more advanced architectures that exploit the technology to its maximum advantage: utility computing and on-demand service discovery and composition, grid computing and multi-agent systems will only become pervasive once the software quality challenges of real-world industrial applications have been addressed. In this paper potential quality issues such as performance, reliability and availability are addressed in terms of the quality assurances that might need to be provided to consumers of services. Proposed XML-based Service Level Agreement (SLA) languages are reviewed as a means of providing these quality assurances in machine-readable ways. We also discuss how SLAs might be automatically negotiated to enable automated, on-demand service discovery and composition. The next section of this paper addresses quality issues from a service provider's perspective. The providers of such services will need to ensure that SLA commitments are met and this poses interesting problems in terms of application management. Network quality of service is currently addressed through such means as IntServ and DiffServ. Research proposals to introduce similar techniques at an application level are described. From the service consumer's perspective, interesting research proposals for proactively ensuring that good quality of service is obtained are also reviewed. These could be particularly important for creating confidence, from a consumer's perspective, in these architectures.

However, customer perceived quality may be affected not simply by the software content and the development process, but also by a number of other factors including deployment issues, amount of usage, software platform, and hardware configurations. We predict customer perceived quality as measured by various service interactions, including software defect reports, requests for assistance, and field technician dispatches using the afore mentioned and other factors for a large telecommunications software system. We employ the non-intrusive data gathering technique of using existing data captured in automated project monitoring and tracking systems as well as customer support and tracking systems. We find that the effects of deployment schedule, hardware configurations, and software platform can increase the probability of observing a software failure by more than 20 times.

In order to tackle this problem, we focussed on the trend of time series data of software defects among successive testing phases and tried to estimate software quality using the trend. First, we investigate the characteristics of the time series data on the detected faults by observing the change of the number of detected faults. Using the rank correlation coefficient, the data are classified into four kinds of trends. Next, with the intention of estimating software quality, we investigate the relationship between the trends of the time series data and software quality. Here, software quality is defined by the number of faults detected during six months after shipment.

In process-based approach developers study and improve their system's structure at fixed intervals. Tool-based approach uses subjective evaluations as input to tool analysis. These approaches or their combination are expected to improve software design and promote organizational learning about software design.

Timely application of such models can assist in directing quality improvement efforts to modules that are likely to be fp during operations, thereby cost-effectively utilizing the software quality testing and enhancement resources. Since several classification techniques are available, a relative comparative study of some commonly used classification techniques can be useful to practitioners. We present a comprehensive evaluation of the relative performances of seven classification techniques and/or tools. These include logistic regression, case-based reasoning, classification and regression trees (CART), tree-based classification with S-PLUS, and the Sprint-Sliq, C4.5, and Treedisc algorithms. The use of expected cost of misclassification (ECM), is introduced as a singular unified measure to compare the performances of different software quality classification models. A function of the costs of the Type I (a nfp module misclassified as fp) and Type II (a fp module misclassified as nfp) misclassifications, ECM is computed for different cost ratios. Evaluating software quality classification models in the presence of varying cost ratios is important, because the usefulness of a model is dependent on the system-specific costs of misclassifications. Moreover, models should be compared and preferred for cost ratios that fall within the range of interest for the given system and project domain. Software metrics were collected from four successive releases of a large legacy telecommunications system. A two-way ANOVA randomized-complete block design modeling approach is used, in which the system release is treated as a block, while the modeling method is treated as a factor. It is observed that predictive performances of the models is significantly different across the system releases, implying that in the software engineering domain prediction models are influenced by the characteristics of the data and the system being modeled. Multiple-pairwise comparisons are performed to evaluate the relative performances of the seven models for the cost ratios of interest to the case study. In addition, the performance of the seven classification techniques is also compared with a classification based on lines of code. The comparative approach presented in this paper can also be applied to other software systems."

It begins with a commentary on quality issues for systems development and various stakeholders' involvement. It revisits aspects and concepts of systems development methods and highlights the relevance of quality issues to the choice of a process model. A summarised review of some families of methods is presented, where their application domain, lifecycle coverage, strengths and weaknesses are considered. Under the new development era the requirements of software development change; the role of methods and stakeholders change, too. The paper refers to the latest developments in the area of software engineering and emphasises the shift from traditional conceptual modelling to requirements engineering and process metamodelling principles. We provide support for an emerging discipline in the form of a software process metamodel to cover new issues for software quality and process improvement. The widening of the horizons of software engineering both as a 'communication tool' and as a 'scientific discipline' (and not as a 'craft') is needed in order to support both communicative and scientific quality systems properties. In general, we can consider such a discipline as a thinking tool for understanding the generic process and as the origin of combining intuition and quality engineering to transform requirements to adequate human-centred information systems. We conclude with a schematic representation of a Generic Process Metamodel (GPM) indicating facets contributed by Software Engineering, Computer Science, Information Systems, Mathematics, Linguistics, Sociology and Anthropology. Ongoing research and development issues have provided evidence for influence from even more diverse disciplines."

The use of such models prior to system deployment can considerably reduce the likelihood of faults discovered during operations, hence improving system reliability. A software quality classification model is calibrated using metrics from a past release or similar project, and is then applied to modules currently under development. Subsequently, a timely prediction of which modules are likely to have faults can be obtained. However, software quality classification models used in practice may not provide a useful balance between the two misclassification rates, especially when there are very few faulty modules in the system being modeled. This paper presents, in the context of case-based reasoning, two practical classification rules that allow appropriate emphasis on each type of misclassification as per the project requirements. The suggested techniques are especially useful for high-assurance systems where faulty modules are rare. The proposed generalized classification methods emphasize on the costs of misclassifications, and the unbalanced distribution of the faulty program modules. We illustrate the proposed techniques with a case study that consists of software measurements and fault data collected over multiple releases of a large-scale legacy telecommunication system. In addition to investigating the two classification methods, a brief relative comparison of the techniques is also presented. It is indicated that the level of classification accuracy and model-robustness observed for the case study would be beneficial in achieving high software reliability of its subsequent system releases. Similar observations are made from our empirical studies with other case studies."

An early software fault prediction is a proven technique in achieving high software reliability. Prediction models based on software metrics can predict number of faults in software modules. Timely predictions of such models can be used to direct cost-effective quality enhancement efforts to modules that are likely to have a high number of faults. We evaluate the predictive performance of six commonly used fault prediction techniques: CART-LS (least squares), CART-LAD (least absolute deviation), S-PLUS, multiple linear regression, artificial neural networks, and case-based reasoning. The case study consists of software metrics collected over four releases of a very large telecommunications system. Performance metrics, average absolute and average relative errors, are utilized to gauge the accuracy of different prediction models. Models were built using both, original software metrics (RAW) and their principle components (PCA). Two-way ANOVA randomized-complete block design models with two blocking variables are designed with average absolute and average relative errors as response variables. System release and the model type (RAW or PCA) form the blocking variables and the prediction technique is treated as a factor. Using multiple-pairwise comparisons, the performance order of prediction models is determined. We observe that for both average absolute and average relative errors, the CART-LAD model performs the best while the S-PLUS model is ranked sixth."

In this paper the GEQUAMO (GEneric, multilayered and customisable) QUAlity MOdel is proposed. GEQUAMO encapsulates the requirements of different stakeholders in a dynamic and flexible manner so as to enable each stakeholder (developer, user or sponsor) to construct their own model reflecting the emphasis/weighting for each attribute/requirement.

The underlying principle of the approach is the encoding of experts' tacit knowledge into probabilistic measures associated with the achievement level of software quality attributes. An aggregated quality measure is obtained based on preference statements related to the quality attributes. The technical objectives of the paper are to develop of a generic and operationally feasible measurement technique to transform the tacit knowledge of a software expert to a probability distribution depicting his/her uncertainty of the level of achievement related to a quality attribute; to develop rules for the construction of a consensus probability measure based on expert-specific probability measures; to derive a framework for specifying software quality strategy and for evaluating the acceptance of a software produced in a software development process; The above technical developments are used to support group decision-making regarding the launch or implementation decision of a software version; the allocation of resources during the software development process.

This is one reason why quality has become essential for ensuring that a company's products and processes meet customers' needs. A recent innovation in the systems area is the development of a set of mechanisms and models for evaluating quality. This article describes the design of a Quality Model with a systemic approach to software products that assesses a product's efficiency and effectiveness. Different quality models were studied: McCall, Boehm, FURPS, ISO 9126, Dromey, ISO 15504 in an attempt to identify the aspects present in these models that are deemed important in a Systemic Quality model. We designed a model prototype that reflects the essential attributes of quality. This model was evaluated using a method so it can be validated and also enhanced. The evaluation method consisted of: designing a survey, formulating, validating and applying the measurement instruments; defining an algorithm to obtain the quality estimate and analyzing the results. The model prototype enabled the strengths and weaknesses of the software products studied to be identified. When evaluating a software product using the model prototype, it was possible to ascertain its compliance with the standards and use the results to improve it. Since the evaluation was systemic, processes that affect certain characteristics of the product could be identified. Companies can benefit from the model proposed because it serves as a benchmark that allows their products to evolve and be competitive."

When traditional software development processes fail to deliver the level of reliability demanded by customers, radical changes in software development processes may he needed, business process reengineering (BPR) is the popular term for comprehensive redesign of business processes. This paper focuses on the business processes that produce commercial software, and illustrates the central role that models have in implementation of BPR. Software metrics and software-quality modeling technology enable reengineering of software development processes, moving from a static process model to a dynamic one that adapts to the expected quality of each module. We present a method for cost-benefit analysis of BPR of software development processes as a function of model accuracy. The paper defines costs, benefits, profit, and return on investment from both short-term and long-term perspectives. The long-term perspective explicitly accounts for software maintenance efforts. A case study of a very large legacy telecommunications system illustrates the method. The dependent variable of the software-quality model was whether a module will have faults discovered by customers. The independent variables were software product and process metrics. In an example, the costs and benefits of using the model are compared to using random selection of modules for reliability enhancement. Such a cost-benefit analysis clarifies the implications of following model recommendations."

Modeling software quality with classification trees is attractive because they readily model nonmonotonic relationships. In this paper, we apply the TREEDISC algorithm which is a refinement of the CHAID algorithm to build classification-tree models. CHAID-based algorithms differ from other classification-tree algorithms in their reliance on chi-squared tests when building the tree. Classification-tree models are vulnerable to overfitting, where the model reflects the structure of the training data set too closely. Even though a model appears to be accurate on training data, if overfitted, it may be much less accurate when applied to a current data set. To account for the severe consequences of misclassifying fault-prone modules, our measure of overfitting is based on expected costs of misclassification, rather than the total number of misclassifications. We conducted a case study of a very large telecommunications system. A two-way analysis of variance with repetitions found that TREEDISC's significance level was highly related to overfitting, and can be used to control it. Moreover, the minimum number of modules in a leaf also influenced the degree of overfitting."

This company has been active in this area since 1993, trying to build, introduce and maintain an efficiently working quality management system which, e.g., fulfils the ISO 9001 requirements, allows steady software process improvement and, at the same time, conforms to company's own needs. Over the last eight years five phases could be distinguished. Each phase is described shortly, following the same structure, namely: basic starting points, key problem areas, literature consulted, activities and design executed, reflections on what happened and why. The lessons resulting from the analysis of this case have been formulated in terms of guidelines. We feel that these are applicable to any low maturity software development organisation embarking on a product or process quality improvement endeavour. These guidelines are developed around a framework containing the basic issues of software production (project management, technical processes and products). The guidelines advocate a careful step-by-step development of definitions, quality characteristics, and metrics related to these objects while at the same time developing and introducing the associated process."

Developers and managers can use such predictions by software quality models to focus enhancement efforts before release. However, in practice, software quality modeling methods in the literature may not produce a useful balance between the two kinds of misclassification rates, especially when there are few faulty modules. This paper presents a practical classification rule in the context of classification tree models that allows appropriate emphasis on each type of misclassification according to the needs of the project. This is especially important when the faulty modules are rare. An industrial case study using classification trees, illustrates the tradeoffs. The trees were built using the TREEDISC algorithm which is a refinement of the CHAID algorithm. We examined two releases of a very large telecommunications system, and built models suited to two points in the development life cycle: the end of coding and the end of beta testing. Both trees had only five significant predictors, out of 28 and 42 candidates, respectively. We interpreted the structure of the classification trees, and we found the models had useful accuracy."

ISO 9001, for example, provides guidance for monitoring and controlling product and process characteristics during both production and installation. However, standards provide little guidance as to what exactly users should measure and how to use the results to support the development of high-quality software. Furthermore, measurement cannot be defined independent of context. A metric set judged valid on one project may lead to poor quality or high development costs when applied to another project. When quality is measured, several factors come into play, including product characteristics (such as size), process maturity level of the company developing the software product, its development environment (such as the design methodology and CASE tools used), and the development team's skill and experience."

Quality of the software product cannot be determined until late in the development cycle. It is widely accepted that reliance has to be placed on process quality as a means of achieving product quality. In recent years software organisations have been making efforts concentrating on improving the process in order to improve software quality. Hofstede (Hofstede 1994) had defined four dimensions of work-related value differences for classifying cultural influences in different countries. These are: power distance, collectivism/individualism, femininity/masculinity and uncertainty avoidance. In this paper software development organisations are being assessed for their awareness and acceptance of Software Quality. These results will be correlated with the work-related values identified by Hofstede. The intention is to identify cultural factors, which may have a bearing on successful adoption and implementation of Software Quality Management."

Without a defined process it is impossible to measure success or focus on how development capability can be enhanced. To date, a number of software process improvement frameworks have been developed and implemented. However, most of these models have been targeted at large-scale producers. Furthermore, they have applied to companies who use traditional development techniques. Smaller companies and those operating in development areas where speed of delivery is paramount have not, as yet, had process improvement paradigms available for adoption. This study examined the software process in a small company and emerged with the recommendation of the use of the Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM) and the Personal Software Process (PSP) for achieving software process improvement."

This paper describes the support activity of a software quality analysis & measurement service which is performed by our team of laboratory within the company as a third-party independent staff group. We call this activity HQC (High Quality software creation support virtual Center). The purpose of this activity is as follows. First we improve the software quality engineering process in the development department, for example, we help them to increase efficiency of review or testing. To accomplish this, we use program static analysis tools to detect fault-prone software components. Next we assist in starting their own self-improvement process. In addition, we provide service activity to many development departments concurrently. We have been making progress with these activities, and some development departments have begun to establish improvement process themselves."

The proponents of PSQM claim that it has a significant impact on some essential parameters of a software producer's competitiveness. However, case studies of some well known software producers reveal a rather different management style. Since the management style is a means to influence the essential parameters of a company's competitiveness, which are influenced by the competitive conditions, two questions arise. 1. Do the investigated software producers employ a different management style by accident or is their management style an appropriate answer to their specific competitive conditions? 2. If their management style is an appropriate answer to their competitive conditions, what is specific about these conditions and about the appropriate management style? It is argued, that their management style is a form of concurrent engineering, which rather conforms the needs of a software producer in a turbulent environment, while PSQM on the other hand rather conforms the needs of a software producer in a placid environment. This means, there is no universal process management and environmental dynamics is a contingency factor to be considered in the configuration of process management. © 2000 Kluwer Academic Publishers."

Tools for the support of the measurement process are herein classified as Computer Assisted Software Measurement and Evaulation Tools (CAME Tools). Software measurement regarded as a special type of metrics application provides a great amount of basic information for the evaluation of the software development process or the software product itself. Our paper examines the effectiveness and destination of software measurement in tool-based software development and is based on an analysis of more than 20 CAME tools in the Software Measurement Laboratory at the University of Magdeburg. CAME tools are useable for the process, product, and resources evaluation in all phases of the software life cycle (including the problem definition) for different development paradigms. The efficiency of CAME tools is described on the basis of a general measurement framework. This framework includes all steps in the software measurement and evaulation process: metrics definition, selection of the evaluation criteria, tool-based modelling and measurement, value presentation and statistical analysis. The framework includes the main aspects of the process evaluation techniques (Capability Maturity Model, ISO 9000-3 etc.) and product evaluation (ISO 9126, etc.). It is not a disjointed set of aspects: our measurement framework represents an incremental technique for the application of quantification of quality aspects in a required quality assurance."

In 1994, an effort to develop a common interface using TCP/IP and Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) began with a product being developed in the C. The product, which was officially delivered in June of 1994, was coded using structured programming techniques. However, after the product had been in use for some time, maintaining and extending the code for additional functionality and portability was less than desirable. A decision was made by the programmers who support the host-side code to restructure (re-engineer) it such that certain software engineering principles be included into the product to make the product more maintainable and portable.

Advantages of using QFD are: better focus on customers and users, an effective means of prioritizing and communicating software requirements; and managing non-functional requirements. Issues not fully supported by QFD include adequate abstractions levels in describing requirements, handling temporal relations between requirements and initiating the use of QFD for a new development project."

We discovered significant differences between senior managers' perceptions and the reality of what quality practices took place. In particular, use of reviews and inspections, which are widely believed to be an extremely cost-effective QA procedure, was very limited even when safety critical software was being developed. On the other hand there was widespread use of development and coding standards whose value is questionable.

Reliable data about current practice are hard to get as no one likes to admit that they are producing poor software. In a recent survey, Wilson has taken an approach to obtaining data about the practice of software quality assurance among companies in Australia. The same technique has been used here to investigate practice among companies in Europe and America. The survey aims to investigate quality systems used by the organizations, and the application of these systems by software developers. In this paper they are compared with the Australian experience and the results of the survey shown. The company's demographic data and overall response pattern from this survey are compared with Wilson's.

Errors tolerated in word-processing software may not be acceptable in control software for a nuclear power plant. Thus, the meanings of 'safety-critical' and 'mission-critical' must be reexamined in the context of software's contribution to the larger functionality and quality of products and businesses.

The case study was based on a sample of modules, representing about 1.3 million lines of code, from a very large telecommunications system. Software quality models were developed to predict the number of faults expected from the coding through operations phases. Since modules from the prior release were often reused to develop a new release, one model incorporated reuse data as additional independent variables. We compare this model's performance to a similar model without reuse data. Software quality models often have product metrics as the only input data for predicting quality. There is an implicit assumption that all the modules have had a similar development history, so that product attributes are the primary drivers of different quality levels. Reuse of software as components and software evolution do not fit this assumption very well, and consequently, traditional models for such environments may not have adequate accuracy. Focusing on the software maintenance phase, this study demonstrated that reuse data can significantly improve the predictive accuracy of software quality models. © 1996 Kluwer Academic Publishers."

Goals and actions related to a repeatable project management process have been outlined in the Capability Maturity Model (CMM) developed by the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. The CMM provides good guidelines for initiating software process improvement particularly in the project management area; however, the successful implementation of the CMM guidelines is often not accomplished without significant organizational change involving increased emphasis on change management, teams and employee empowerment. This paper is empirically based on observations, surveys, and interviews of project team managers and project team members in a large, multinational organization. The focus of the paper is on the development of a project management process that emphasizes project planning, change management, quality management, team work, and process control. Findings presented in this paper are correlated with the CMM guidelines as well as organizational factors that were found to enable or impede the successful deployment of various aspects of a project management improvement plan. The role of education and training in process and quality techniques as well as project management tools that support group work is also examined. This paper provides some insight into the issues faced by organizations based on traditional hierarchy or matrix management as they attempt to move into a more process-driven, quality-oriented development environment. As organizations move towards global markets they need increased emphasis on quality, value, teams, standards and global project management strategies based on structured guidelines to handle process Sow within and between projects, departments, organizations, and national boundaries. © 1996 Chapman & Hall."

However, there are still several problems with providing effective feedback to intermediate software products and the software development process. We have proposed a software quality management using quality metrics which are easily and automatically measured. The purpose of this proposal is to establish a method for building in software quality by regularly measuring and reviewing. This paper outlines a model for building in software quality using quality metrics, and describes examples of its application to actual projects and its results. As the results, it was found that quality metrics can be used to detect and remove problems with process and products in each phase. Regular technical reviews using quality metrics and information on the change of the regularly measured results was also found to have a positive influence on the structure and module size of programs. Further, in the test phase, it was found that with the proposed model, the progress of corrective action could be quickly and accurately grasped."

To restore these metrics to effective use, process changes were required for setting quality and metric targets, and for the way the metrics are used for tracking development progress. With these process changes in place, and the addition of a new metric, the case history demonstrates that the metric set could be used effectively to indicate problems in this release and help manage changes to the plan for completion of the release.

Quality factors, like reliability, are of more interest to customers than metrics, like complexity. However quality factors cannot be collected until late in a project. Therefore the need arises to validate metrics, which developers can collect early in a project, against a quality factor.

This paper underscores the danger of following the gurus of Japanese management too closely, of reifying packaged 'solutions' to quality problems and of pursuing universal principles of human resource management in the software sphere as elsewhere. The human side of software development is presented in terms of complex patterns of social interaction-incorporating organizational politics, personal conflicts and collective antagonisms-which potentially exert a powerful constraining influence on software Japanization. The message drawn from this is that software professionals should avoid importing human resource techniques wholesale in the hope of securing automatic quality improvements, and that greater thought is required in evaluating theoretical and prescriptive material from areas outside traditional software engineering. © 1994 Chapman & Hall."

The idea of QDA has been gradually applied to software since 1982, however, the framework for QDA is still immature. It is necessary to design a sound QDA framework for software, but this is not easy, because no guidelines for designing a QDA framework are provided. This paper, with a focus on customer-specific business software, presents a guideline for designing a QDA framework. The guideline will be applicable to other software classes, also. The key points in the guideline are: to understand QDA fundamental features; to clarify basic standpoints for the framework design; to select necessary relationship matrices; to develop and refine a matrix sequence diagram; to establish a procedural order for developing the relationship matrices; and to develop ways of using the relationship matrices. The guideline produces a QDA framework for customer-specific business software, which is of benefit to both the developer and the customer. This paper discusses it from a methodological point of view, and presents the ideas of consistency analysis, priority propagation, buying-points analysis and design-points analysis. Furthermore, it presents a concrete example of the QDA framework. The QDA framework has strong customer orientation. QDA is primarily a quality-focused approach. If incorporated in the software development, the QDA framework forces an explicit link between quality references and the functions and activities that relate to them, and it will be helpful for producing strongly customer-oriented and quality-focused software activities. © 1994 Chapman & Hall."

The aim of the paper is to pursue the issues of how these approaches affect people, in our case software developers, and how we can assess the effectiveness of each approach in actually achieving quality software. An outline of the main aspects of the organizational approach - process modelling and software standards - is given. In order to address the effects of each of these modes of thought on people we take a psychological perspective. The implications for software engineering, in terms of formalism and mechanization, are discussed. The paper argues that overzealous structure, control and automation can negatively affect the creative process of developing software. A perspective on each of the components of the technical approach in terms of their effectiveness in achieving quality objectives is provided. From recent work we find that process modelling and many software standards do not provide an adequate assessment of the benefits derived from their application. The paper argues that measurement goes some way to addressing these problems. Measurement should form the core of the software development process, especially with respect to product quality assessment. The main conclusion is that by focusing on measurable objectives and results we can best achieve quality software products and highlight the processes which are likely to create them in a repeatable and manageable fashion. Additionally, by adopting measurement in practice we should expect to increase the freedom and creativity of software developers. © 1994 Chapman & Hall."

Though our views are based upon experiences with large telecommunications systems, they are likely to be useful to many other developers of large software systems."

This paper documents an attempt to provide an empirical metrics ″view″ of such initiatives based on data collected in a worldwide benchmarking effort conducted between March, 1991 and December, 1991. Surprisingly, of the more than 300 organizations that participated, fewer than 1 in 5 had any quantifiable performance data available prior to the start of this study. However, those that had embarked on significant process improvement efforts and were actively using metrics were able to demonstrate substantial gains in productivity and quality. In addition, insights derived from this large scale data analysis provide a framework for determining which metrics should be included in a standard software engineering measurement 'dashboard'."

It is commercially significant because of the large sums of money spent correcting problems within information systems. The literature shows how various theoretical treatments have developed since the late 1970s. However, many of these models are of academic interest only, because they are not perceived by IT professionals to meet their needs. This article describes a study which examined the nature of quality in six different commercial environments. The aim of the study was to provide models of quality appropriate to individual commercial environments and to examine similarities between them. The results, expressed in terms of quality criteria and the relationships between them, highlight the limitations of many theoretical treatments, in particular, the highly technical view of software quality enshrined in early models, and the need for criteria contributing to 'business correctness'. The results from the study are used to highlight some of the important issues in software quality within commercial environments and some of the reasons why quality is often poor. © 1992 Chapman & Hall."

Consequently, the standard has been rewritten to conform to the International Standard (ISO) 9001 for the highest level of quality management and to incorporate some lessons learned from the first edition (which was in a slightly different format). This article discusses some experiences of both implementors of the standard and of assessors of the systems. There is also a summary of the clauses of the standard and discussion of some changes made between the two editions of the documents. Published with the 1991 edition is another document that is an implementation guide to help the smaller companies in the industry to implement their quality management systems.

A constructive definition of quality is investigated and an approach to the construction of software of quality is suggested. The definition focusses on how well the solution fits the problem, the inherent quality of the design independent of the problem, and the quality of the design process that creates the solution. A constructive specification of software quality then follows based on the use of programming language syntax, design principles and strategies, post-construction program quality analysis systems, and computer-assisted program construction tools. Only by addressing the problem on much broader methodological, technical, and managerial fronts will it be possible to make significant gains in software quality. © 1992 Chapman & Hall."

Specifically, software quality was measured in terms of the system operation. The testing phase analyzed, stability test, was an operational profile-driven test in that a controlled load was imposed on the system reflective of the system's busy-hour usage pattern. The usage profile was determined from requirements specifying both the frequency of invocation of each command and the alarm arrival rate for the largest expected user site. For this controlled test environment, a Poisson-type reliability growth model, the exponential nonhomogeneous Poisson process model, exhibited a good fit to the observed failure data. Furthermore, the model demonstrated predictive power for future failure rates. It is concluded that the use of an operational profile to drive system test is an effective test strategy and that the operational profile must be taken into account when predicting field reliability from reliability measured during test."

The tool is based on a software engineering methodology called SOM (SDL-oriented methodology). This includes the internationally standardized Specification and Description Language (SDL) defined by CCITT. The use of DASOM increases productivity and quality significantly. The estimated productivity increase is 20-70%. Higher quality is achieved because a formalized methodology is used in combination with syntax and consistency checks provided by the tool."

The index indicates the software quality based on program test results and consists of two subindices: the test accuracy index and the test coverage index. The test accuracy index can be measured by applying the capture-recapture method. Pseudo defects called control defects are seeded prior to the test and their capture ratio is measured as the ratio of the number of detected defects to the estimated number of detectable defects (estimated by applying the software reliability growth model). Two experimental results are presented and the SPQL is compared with both the ordinary capture-recapture method and the software reliability growth prediction based method. The result indicates that the SPQL is practical. © 1982 IEEE."

Its main results and conclusions are: • Explicit attention to characteristics of software quality can lead to significant savings in software life-cycle costs. • The current software state-of-the-art imposes specific limitations on our ability to automatically and quantitatively evaluate the quality of software. • A definitive hierarchy of well-defined, well-differentiated characteristics of software quality is developed. Its higher-level structure reflects the actual uses to which software quality evaluation would be put; its lower-level characteristics are closely correlated with actual software metric evaluations which can be performed. • A large number of software quality-evaluation metrics have been defined, classified, and evaluated with respect to their potential benefits, quantifiability, and ease of automation. • Particular software life-cycle activities have been identified which have significant leverage on software quality. Most importantly, we believe that the study reported in this paper provides for the first time a clear, well-defined framework for assessing the often slippery issues associated with software quality, via the consistent and mutually supportive sets of definitions, distinctions, guidelines, and experiences cited. This framework is certainly not complete, but it has been brought to a point sufficient to serve as a viable basis for future refinements and extensions. © 1976 IEEE Computer Society.
