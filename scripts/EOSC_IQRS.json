		"abstract": "This document is based on an extract from CESSDA Technical Architecture v1.0, May 2016. It was created so that readers interested in CESSDA’s Software Maturity Levels (SMLs) can find out more, without having to browse through the entire Technical Architecture document. Usability is not only a political imperative of European Research Infrastructure Consortiums’ need to maximise their return on investment, but is also essential for growth with limited funds and ongoing interoperability. Mandating and checking the sustainability/usability of the software components of CESSDA’s technical Research Infrastructure is essential if it is to strengthen and grow, however there are always risks attached, for example: how much effort is required to integrate it into the current technical framework, how will it be maintained, does it conform to the standards required? Therefore the need to measure the maturity of software designed for use by CESSDA is essential to ensure the quality of the technical Research Infrastructure is maintained.",

This work is built upon a survey and documentation of a representative panel of current operational infrastructures across Europe, comparing their scopes and approaches. This report summarises the state of the art, identifies best practices, as well as open problems, and paves the way for federating the different approaches in view of supporting the software pillar of EOSC.",

		"abstract": "Software is essential in modern research; it plays vital roles at multiple stages of the research lifecycle. The term Research Software is widely used in the academic community but, what do we mean when we use these terms? Software and research? When you think of software, you may think of a digital object that is executed on a machine. Yet software is more than just this, it is a complex and evolving artifact. It may be a concept or a project designed to solve a puzzle by a team or a community that develops its functionalities and algorithms, which might not be digital objects. Furthermore, the software artifacts are digital objects, e.g., executables and source code files for different environments. These digital artifacts, which are used in a scholarly setting, might be important in the research process, but should all these be considered Research Software? This report is the result of a discussion examining the scope of the community definition of the FAIR principles for Research Software as part of the work in the FAIR for Research Software working group (FAIR4RS). We aim to clarify the scope of the FAIR principles by identifying which software artifacts the FAIR principles should apply to. This discussion portrayed a complex landscape of software uses in research and existing definitions that can help to better understand the complexity of different types of software in academia. Finally we determine the scope of the FAIR4RS with a short and concise definition of Research Software as a separate metaphor of software in research.",
