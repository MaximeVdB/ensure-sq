The elicitation, analysis, and specification of quality requirements involve careful balancing of a broad spectrum of competing priorities. Developers must therefore focus on identifying qualities and designing solutions that optimize the product's value to its stakeholders. © 2008 IEEE.

# 81 - Integrating fuzzy theory and hierarchy concepts to evaluate software quality

## Chang C.-W., Wu C.-R., Lin H.-L.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-42149193088&doi=10.1007%2fs11219-007-9035-2&partnerID=40&md5=c0726b7b8745845e0160bf4ff0966f32

This study proposes a software quality evaluation model and its computing algorithm. Existing software quality evaluation models examine multiple characteristics and are characterized by factorial fuzziness. The relevant criteria of this model are derived from the international norm ISO. The main objective of this paper is to propose a novel Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) approach for addressing uncertainty and imprecision in service evaluation during pre-negotiation stages, where comparative judgments of decision makers are represented as fuzzy triangular numbers. A new fuzzy prioritization method, which derives crisp priorities from consistent and inconsistent fuzzy comparison matrices, is proposed. The Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP)-based decision-making method can provide decision makers or buyers with a valuable guideline for evaluating software quality. Importantly, the proposed model can aids users and developers in assessing software quality, making it highly applicable for academic and commercial purposes. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

# 82 - The EMISQ method - Expert based evaluation of internal software quality

## Plösch R., Gruber H., Hentschel A., Körner Ch., Pomberger G., Schiffer S., Saft M., Storck S.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-47749132628&doi=10.1109%2fSEW.2007.71&partnerID=40&md5=cd7975c8b3e6f9fec2a175545c539b15

Internal software quality, e.g. the quality of code, has great impact on the overall quality of software. Besides well known manual inspection and review techniques more recent approaches utilize tool-based static code for the evaluation of internal software quality. Despite the high potential of static code analyzers the application of tools alone cannot replace well founded expert opinion. Knowledge, experience and fair judgement is indispensable for a valid, reliable quality assessment, which is accepted by software developers and managers. The EMISQ method (Evaluation Method for Internal Software Quality), guides the assessment process for all stakeholders of an evaluation project. The method is supported by a tool that assists evaluators with their analysis and rating tasks and provides support for generating a code quality report. The application of the method in a pilot project has shown its applicability.

# 83 - In search for a widely applicable and accepted software quality model for software quality engineering

## Côté M.-A., Suryn W., Georgiadou E.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-36549049028&doi=10.1007%2fs11219-007-9029-0&partnerID=40&md5=59c39869ee11beea4f39ae055a8804c0

Software Quality Engineering is an emerging discipline that is concerned with improving the approach to software quality. It is important that this discipline be firmly rooted in a quality model satisfying its needs. In order to define the needs of this discipline, the meaning of quality is broadly defined by reviewing the literature on the subject. Software Quality Engineering needs a quality model that is usable throughout the software lifecycle and that it embraces all the perspectives of quality. The goal of this paper is to propose the characteristics of a quality model suitable for such a purpose, through the comparative evaluation of existing quality models and their respective support for Software Quality Engineering. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

# 84 - An analysis of software quality management at AWE plc.

## Elliott M., Dawson R., Edwards J.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-36549027018&doi=10.1007%2fs11219-007-9027-2&partnerID=40&md5=fc0cba2f7f72e75b8bc9dec833b08d8b

A detailed question set is required to test and measure the true extent that a software quality management system is adopted and implemented across a large company like Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE) plc. The analysis of the gathered data reveals specific topics of weakness that can also reflect the cultural acceptance or resistance that management groups have towards the adoption of quality systems. Having identified detailed problems and barriers, effective strategies and programmes can be deployed to improve the level of implementation and, therefore, the effectiveness of a software quality management system. This paper presents the question set used and the subsequent results obtained from the implementation assessment for 55 software systems at AWE plc. The data is collated into management groups and the associated cultures discussed. The topics of weakness are highlighted together with the very specific actions that are least undertaken. A range of improvement actions is also presented. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

# 85 - Achieving quality in open-source software

## Aberdour M.

The open source software community has published a substantial body of research on OSS quality. Focusing on this peer-reviewed body of work lets us draw conclusions from empirical data rather than rely on the large volume of evangelical opinion that has historically dominated this field. This body of published research has become much more critical and objective in its efforts to understand OSS development, and a consensus has emerged on the key components of high-quality OSS delivery. This article reviews this body of research and draws out lessons learned, investigating how the approaches used to deliver high-quality OSS differ from, and can be incorporated into, closed-source software development. © 2007 IEEE.

# 86 - Using fault slippage measurement for monitoring software process quality during development

## Damm L.-O., Lundberg L.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84885655995&doi=10.1145%2f1137702.1137707&partnerID=40&md5=a72e3ef2602755e39c97e34a92a563e9

In a competitive environment where time-to-market is crucial for success, software development companies initiate process improvement programs that can shorten the development time. They especially seek improvements in the verification activities since rework commonly constitutes a significant part of the development cost. However, the success of process improvement initiatives is dependent on early and observable results since a lack of feedback on the effect of improvements is a common cause of failure. This paper investigates how to monitor the verification process as input to decisions such as improvement actions. The suggested approach was applied on three industrial software products at Ericsson and the results determined that the approach can be used for quantitative monitoring of process quality and as decision support to do rapid improvement actions. © 2006 ACM.

# 87 - Experiments on quality evaluation of embedded software in Japan robot software design contest

## Washizaki H., Kobayashi Y., Watanabe H.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-34247114304&partnerID=40&md5=f38f8d7a84c99a1f2ee51e8639582d1c

As a practical opportunity for educating Japanese young developers in the field of embedded software development, a software design contest involving the design of software to automatically control a line-trace robot, and conduct running performance tests was held. In this paper, we give the results of the contest from the viewpoint of software quality evaluation. We create a framework for evaluating the software quality which integrated design model quality and the final system performance, and conduct analysis using the framework. As a result of analysis, it is found that the quantitative measurement of the structural complexity of the design models bears a strong relationship to qualitative evaluation of the design conducted by judges. It is also found that there is no strong correlation between design model quality evaluated by the judges and the final system performance. For embedded software development, it is particularly important to estimate and verify reliability and performance in the early stages, using the model. Based on the analysis result, we consider possible remedies with respect to the models submitted, the evaluation methods used and the contest specifications. In order to adequately measure several non-functional quality characteristics including performance on the model, it is necessary to improve the way of developing robot software (such as applying model driven development) and reexamine the evaluation methods.

# 89 - An instrument for the measurement of customer perceptions of quality management in the software industry: An empirical study in India

## Issac G., Rajendran C., Anantharaman R.N.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33749595095&doi=10.1007%2fs11219-006-0037-2&partnerID=40&md5=ef13c6f2124ac39949bd868ebb09a2e0

Most of the available literature on quality management is based on management's perception; few studies examine critical issues of quality management from the customer's perspective, especially in the software industry. In order to gain an insight into what customers expect from a product/service, an analysis of quality management from customer's point of view is essential. Such an understanding would help the managers to adopt strategies that can enhance the satisfaction level of their customers. The present study highlights the critical factors of quality management in the software industry from the customer's perspective. Six critical factors are identified: and an instrument, comprising these factors, is developed and validated so as to measure the customer's perception of quality management in the software industry. © Springer Science + Business Media, LLC 2006.

# 90 - A quantitative approach for setting technical targets based on impact analysis in software quality function deployment (SQFD)

## Liu F., Noguchi K., Dhungana A., Srirangam A. V.V.N.S.N., Inuganti P.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33746875209&doi=10.1007%2fs11219-006-7598-y&partnerID=40&md5=6eecb6909b62121f64d43e6f2daed4c7

Target setting in software quality function deployment (SQFD) is very important since it is directly related to development of high quality products with high customer satisfaction. However target setting is usually done subjectively in practice, which is not scientific. Two quantitative approaches for setting target values: benchmarking and primitive linear regression have been developed and applied in the past to overcome this problem (Akao and Yoji, 1990). But these approaches cannot be used to assess the impact of unachieved targets on satisfaction of customers for customer requirements. In addition, both of them are based on linear regression and not very practical in many applications. In this paper, we present an innovative quantitative method of setting technical targets in SQFD to enable analysis of impact of unachieved target values on customer satisfaction. It is based on assessment of impact of technical attributes on satisfaction of customer requirements. In addition both linear and non linear regression techniques are utilized in our method, which certainly improves the existing quantitative methods which are based on only linear regression. © Springer Science + Business Media, Inc. 2006.

# 91 - The software quality challenges of service oriented architectures in e-commerce

## Saunders S., Ross M., Staples G., Wellington S.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33244469280&doi=10.1007%2fs11219-006-6002-2&partnerID=40&md5=4a75561cafd69887db2378a084af2ed1

Web Services technologies and their supporting collection of de facto standards are now reaching the point of maturity where they are appearing in production software systems. Service Oriented Architectures (SOAs) using Web Services as an enabling technology are also being discussed widely in the IT press. However, despite the numerous and real advantages of these architectural patterns there are still many software quality challenges that remain unresolved. This is particularly true as we consider more advanced architectures that exploit the technology to its maximum advantage: utility computing and on-demand service discovery and composition, grid computing and multi-agent systems will only become pervasive once the software quality challenges of real-world industrial applications have been addressed. In this paper potential quality issues such as performance, reliability and availability are addressed in terms of the quality assurances that might need to be provided to consumers of services. Proposed XML-based Service Level Agreement (SLA) languages are reviewed as a means of providing these quality assurances in machine-readable ways. We also discuss how SLAs might be automatically negotiated to enable automated, on-demand service discovery and composition. The next section of this paper addresses quality issues from a service provider's perspective. The providers of such services will need to ensure that SLA commitments are met and this poses interesting problems in terms of application management. Network quality of service is currently addressed through such means as IntServ and DiffServ. Research proposals to introduce similar techniques at an application level are described. From the service consumer's perspective, interesting research proposals for proactively ensuring that good quality of service is obtained are also reviewed. These could be particularly important for creating confidence, from a consumer's perspective, in these architectures. Finally, the paper evaluates the challenges and suggests areas where further research is most urgently required. © Springer Science + Business Media, Inc. 2006.

# 92 - Software quality development and assurance in RUP, MSF and XP -A comparative study

## Zuser W., Heil S., Grechenig T.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84885903144&doi=10.1145%2f1083292.1083300&partnerID=40&md5=c47fec6c93dd2cc890ba61b5ce2ab7c1

The support of software quality in a software development process may be regarded under two aspects: first, by providing techniques, which support the development of high quality software and second, by providing techniques, which assure the required quality attributes in existing artifacts. Both approaches have to be combined to achieve effective and successful software engineering. In this study, we compare three of the most industrially relevant software development process models (Rational Unified Process (RUP), Microsoft Solution Framework (MSF) and Extreme Programming (XP)) regarding their software quality support in terms of software quality development and software quality assurance. Based on the results we propose a de-facto standard for quality support in software development process models. © 2005 ACM.

# 93 - Early estimation of software quality using in-process testing metrics: A controlled case study

## Nagappan N., Williams L., Vouk M., Osborne J.

In industrial practice, information on post-release field quality of a product tends to become available too late in the software development process to affordably guide corrective actions. An important step towards remediation of this problem of late information lies in the ability to provide an early estimation of software post-release field quality. This paper presents the use of a suite of in-process metrics that leverages the software testing effort to provide (1) an estimation of potential software field quality in early software development phases, and (2) the identification of low quality software programs. A controlled case study conducted at North Carolina State University provides initial indication that our approach is effective for making an early assessment of post-release field quality. © 2005 ACM.

# 94 - Improving scientific software component quality through assertions

We are proposing research on self-adaptive interface assertion enforcement for the purposes of improving scientific software component quality. Demonstrating software correctness through assertions is a well-known technique for quality improvement. However, the performance penalty is often considered too high for deployment. In order to determine if partial enforcement based on adaptive sampling is a viable solution in performance critical environments, we are pursuing research on mechanisms combining static and dynamic analyses to efficiently maximize assertion checking within performance constraints.

# 95 - A quality-driven systematic approach for architecting distributed software applications

## Ai-Naeem T., Gorton I., Babar M.A., Rabhi F., Benatallah B.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-27844611786&doi=10.1109%2fICSE.2005.1553567&partnerID=40&md5=d9d66cc9571f050d6c26a07b5da85575

Architecting distributed software applications is a complex design activity. It involves making decisions about a number of inter-dependent design choices that relate to a range of design concerns. Each decision requires selecting among a number of alternatives; each of which impacts differently on various quality attributes. Additionally, there are usually a number of stakeholders participating in the decision-making process with different, often conflicting, quality goals, and project constraints, such as cost and schedule. To facilitate the architectural design process, we propose a quantitative quality-driven approach that attempts to find the best possible fit between conflicting stakeholders' quality goals, competing architectural concerns, and project constraints. The approach uses optimization techniques to recommend the optimal candidate architecture. Applicability of the proposed approach is assessed using a real system. Copyright 2005 ACM.

The requirements traceability matrix can successfully predict quality before code is written. However, its tedious development process, requiring analysts to manually discover and vet links between artifact levels, has stymied widespread adoption. The authors' tracing toolkit, called Retro (Requirements Tracing on Target), automates the information retrieval process, making RTM's development easier. Backed by empirical results, the authors describe Retro's advantages over other information retrieval approaches. © 2005 IEEE.

An innovation method that circumvents the complexities, computational overhead, and difficulties involved in calibrating pure or direct three-group classification models was presented. Practioners can utilize an existing two-group classification algorithm thrice in order to yield the three risk-based classes with the application of the proposed method. An empirical approach was taken to investigate the effectiveness and validity of the proposed methodology. It was observed that the expected cost of miscalculation of the proposed three-group models were significantly better when compared to the technique's direct three-group model.

# 98 - A new challenge for applying time series metrics data to software quality estimation

## Amasaki S., Yoshitomi T., Mizuno O., Takagi Y., Kikuno T.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-18244398924&doi=10.1007%2fs11219-005-6216-8&partnerID=40&md5=7d8a24827413547c00fbf8fd55b95279

In typical software development, a software reliability growth model (SRGM) is applied in each testing activity to determine the time to finish the testing. However, there are some cases in which the SRGM does not work correctly. That is, the SRGM sometimes mistakes quality for poor quality products. In order to tackle this problem, we focussed on the trend of time series data of software defects among successive testing phases and tried to estimate software quality using the trend. First, we investigate the characteristics of the time series data on the detected faults by observing the change of the number of detected faults. Using the rank correlation coefficient, the data are classified into four kinds of trends. Next, with the intention of estimating software quality, we investigate the relationship between the trends of the time series data and software quality. Here, software quality is defined by the number of faults detected during six months after shipment. Finally, we find a relationship between the trends and metrics data collected in the software design phase. Using logistic regression, we statistically show that two review metrics in the design and coding phase can determine the trend. © 2005 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc.

This paper examines how the industrial applicability of both ISO/IEC 9126:2001 and MITRE Corporation's Software Quality Assessment Exercise (SQAE) can be bolstered by migrating SQAE's quality model to ISO/IEC 9126:2001. The migration of the quality model is accomplished through the definition of an abstraction layer. The consolidated quality model is examined and further improvements to enrich the assessment of quality are enumerated. © 2005 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc.
