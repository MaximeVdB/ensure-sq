## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84886391532&doi=10.1109%2fICSE.2013.6606723&partnerID=40&md5=191e7233ea6777ff76ebefbf832bbda5

The literature reports that source code lexicon plays a paramount role in program comprehension, especially when software documentation is scarce, outdated or simply not available. In source code, a significant proportion of vocabulary can be either acronyms and-or abbreviations or concatenation of terms that can not be identified using consistent mechanisms such as naming conventions. It is, therefore, essential to disambiguate concepts conveyed by identifiers to support program comprehension and reap the full benefit of Information Retrieval-based techniques (e.g., feature location and traceability) whose linguistic information (i.e., source code identifiers and comments) used across all software artifacts (e.g., requirements, design, change requests, tests, and source code) must be consistent. To this aim, we propose source code vocabulary normalization approaches that exploit contextual information to align the vocabulary found in the source code with that found in other software artifacts. We were inspired in the choice of context levels by prior works and by our findings. Normalization consists of two tasks: splitting and expansion of source code identifiers. We also investigate the effect of source code vocabulary normalization approaches on software maintenance tasks. Results of our evaluation show that our contextual-aware techniques are accurate and efficient in terms of computation time than state of the art alternatives. In addition, our findings reveal that feature location techniques can benefit from vocabulary normalization when no dynamic information is available. © 2013 IEEE.

Software quality assessment shall monitor and guide the evolution of a system based on quality measurements. This continuous process should ideally involve multiple stakeholders and provide adequate information for each of them to use. We want to support an effective selection of quality measurements based on the type of software and individual information needs of the involved stakeholders. We propose an approach that brings together quality measurements and individual information needs for a context-sensitive tailoring of information related to a software quality assessment. We address the following research question: How can we better support different stakeholders in the quality assessment of a software system? For that we will devise theories, models, and prototypes to capture their individual information needs, tailor information from software repositories to these needs, and enable a contextual analysis of the quality aspects. Such a context-sensitive tailoring will provide a effective and individual view on the latest development trends in a project. We outline the milestones as well as evaluation approaches in this paper. © 2013 IEEE.

# 42 - Influence of confirmation biases of developers on software quality: An empirical study

## Çalıklı G., Bener A.B.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84875477125&doi=10.1007%2fs11219-012-9180-0&partnerID=40&md5=cc6f8f69000fcbb792e93b5cc875f69d

The thought processes of people have a significant impact on software quality, as software is designed, developed and tested by people. Cognitive biases, which are defined as patterned deviations of human thought from the laws of logic and mathematics, are a likely cause of software defects. However, there is little empirical evidence to date to substantiate this assertion. In this research, we focus on a specific cognitive bias, confirmation bias, which is defined as the tendency of people to seek evidence that verifies a hypothesis rather than seeking evidence to falsify a hypothesis. Due to this confirmation bias, developers tend to perform unit tests to make their program work rather than to break their code. Therefore, confirmation bias is believed to be one of the factors that lead to an increased software defect density. In this research, we present a metric scheme that explores the impact of developers' confirmation bias on software defect density. In order to estimate the effectiveness of our metric scheme in the quantification of confirmation bias within the context of software development, we performed an empirical study that addressed the prediction of the defective parts of software. In our empirical study, we used confirmation bias metrics on five datasets obtained from two companies. Our results provide empirical evidence that human thought processes and cognitive aspects deserve further investigation to improve decision making in software development for effective process management and resource allocation. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

# 43 - Studying the impact of social interactions on software quality

## Bettenburg N., Hassan A.E.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84880701721&doi=10.1007%2fs10664-012-9205-0&partnerID=40&md5=6196585ec2ffd6929a1369e0a035a33c

Correcting software defects accounts for a significant amount of resources in a software project. To make best use of testing efforts, researchers have studied statistical models to predict in which parts of a software system future defects are likely to occur. By studying the mathematical relations between predictor variables used in these models, researchers can form an increased understanding of the important connections between development activities and software quality. Predictor variables used in past top-performing models are largely based on source code-oriented metrics, such as lines of code or number of changes. However, source code is the end product of numerous interlaced and collaborative activities carried out by developers. Traces of such activities can be found in the various repositories used to manage development efforts. In this paper, we develop statistical models to study the impact of social interactions in a software project on software quality. These models use predictor variables based on social information mined from the issue tracking and version control repositories of two large open-source software projects. The results of our case studies demonstrate the impact of metrics from four different dimensions of social interaction on post-release defects. Our findings show that statistical models based on social information have a similar degree of explanatory power as traditional models. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that social information does not substitute, but rather augments traditional source code-based metrics used in defect prediction models. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

# 45 - A systematic review of quality attributes and measures for software product lines

## Montagud S., Abrahão S., Insfran E.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84865626740&doi=10.1007%2fs11219-011-9146-7&partnerID=40&md5=33b25cd0a25fc09685e06cbc9c988f14

It is widely accepted that software measures provide an appropriate mechanism for understanding, monitoring, controlling, and predicting the quality of software development projects. In software product lines (SPL), quality is even more important than in a single software product since, owing to systematic reuse, a fault or an inadequate design decision could be propagated to several products in the family. Over the last few years, a great number of quality attributes and measures for assessing the quality of SPL have been reported in literature. However, no studies summarizing the current knowledge about them exist. This paper presents a systematic literature review with the objective of identifying and interpreting all the available studies from 1996 to 2010 that present quality attributes and/or measures for SPL. These attributes and measures have been classified using a set of criteria that includes the life cycle phase in which the measures are applied; the corresponding quality characteristics; their support for specific SPL characteristics (e. g., variability, compositionality); the procedure used to validate the measures, etc. We found 165 measures related to 97 different quality attributes. The results of the review indicated that 92% of the measures evaluate attributes that are related to maintainability. In addition, 67% of the measures are used during the design phase of Domain Engineering, and 56% are applied to evaluate the product line architecture. However, only 25% of them have been empirically validated. In conclusion, the results provide a global vision of the state of the research within this area in order to help researchers in detecting weaknesses, directing research efforts, and identifying new research lines. In particular, there is a need for new measures with which to evaluate both the quality of the artifacts produced during the entire SPL life cycle and other quality characteristics. There is also a need for more validation (both theoretical and empirical) of existing measures. In addition, our results may be useful as a reference guide for practitioners to assist them in the selection or the adaptation of existing measures for evaluating their software product lines. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

We provide an overview of the approach developed by the Software Improvement Group for code analysis and quality consulting focused on software maintainability. The approach uses a standardized measurement model based on the ISO/IEC 9126 definition of maintainability and source code metrics. Procedural standardization in evaluation projects further enhances the comparability of results. Individual assessments are stored in a repository that allows any system at hand to be compared to the industrywide state of the art in code quality and maintainability. When a minimum level of software maintainability is reached, the certification body of TÜV Informationstechnik GmbH issues a Trusted Product Maintainability certificate for the software product. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.

# 47 - Strategy to improve quality for software applications: A process view

## Becker P., Lew P., Olsina L.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79960589413&doi=10.1145%2f1987875.1987897&partnerID=40&md5=697727eaef77cbebdc3618cbb98affc8

Each organization devoted to developing software/web applications should have as one of its ultimate goals to improve the quality in use of its products. In order to accomplish this, first it has to understand the quality of the current product version and then make appropriate changes to increase the quality of the new version if improvement actions were needed. For this purpose, we have developed a specific strategy called SIQinU (Strategy for understanding and Improving Quality in Use), which allows recognizing problems of quality in use through evaluation and proposes product improvements by understanding and making changes on product attributes. Hence by re-evaluating quality in use of the new version, improvement gains can be gauged. SIQinU is in alignment with GOCAME (Goal-Oriented Context-Aware Measurement and Evaluation), a multi-purpose generic strategy previously developed for measurement and evaluation which relies on: a conceptual framework (with ontological base), a process, and methods and tools. Since the process aspect is paramount in defining SIQinU - given the amount of phases and activities - in this paper we model the functional and behavioral process views illustrating them with excerpts of a real case study. © 2011 ACM.

# 48 - An industrial case study on quality impact prediction for evolving service-oriented software

## Koziolek H., Schlich B., Bilich C., Weiss R., Becker S., Krogmann K., Trifu M., Mirandola R., Koziolek A.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79959911405&doi=10.1145%2f1985793.1985902&partnerID=40&md5=e03e95c9edbcc73b224aa5c8d203d93a

Systematic decision support for architectural design decisions is a major concern for software architects of evolving service-oriented systems. In practice, architects often analyse the expected performance and reliability of design alternatives based on prototypes or former experience. Model-driven prediction methods claim to uncover the tradeoffs between different alternatives quantitatively while being more cost-effective and less error-prone. However, they often suffer from weak tool support and focus on single quality attributes. Furthermore, there is limited evidence on their effectiveness based on documented industrial case studies. Thus, we have applied a novel, model-driven prediction method called Q-ImPrESS on a large-scale process control system consisting of several million lines of code from the automation domain to evaluate its evolution scenarios. This paper reports our experiences with the method and lessons learned. Benefits of Q-ImPrESS are the good architectural decision support and comprehensive tool framework, while one drawback is the time-consuming data collection. © 2011 ACM.

# 49 - Configuring global software teams: A multi-company analysis of project productivity, quality, and profits

In this paper, we examined the impact of project-level configurational choices of globally distributed software teams on project productivity, quality, and profits. Our analysis used data from 362 projects of four different firms. These projects spanned a wide range of programming languages, application domain, process choices, and development sites spread over 15 countries and 5 continents. Our analysis revealed fundamental tradeoffs in choosing configurational choices that are optimized for productivity, quality, and/or profits. In particular, achieving higher levels of productivity and quality require diametrically opposed configurational choices. In addition, creating imbalances in the expertise and personnel distribution of project teams significantly helps increase profit margins. However, a profit-oriented imbalance could also significantly affect productivity and/or quality outcomes. Analyzing these complex tradeoffs, we provide actionable managerial insights that can help software firms and their clients choose configurations that achieve desired project outcomes in globally distributed software development. © 2011 ACM.

# 50 - Pragmatic prioritization of software quality assurance efforts

## Shihab E.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79959864680&doi=10.1145%2f1985793.1986007&partnerID=40&md5=0e2ecdae077441ec1422a8aaa4bbf673

A plethora of recent work leverages historical data to help practitioners better prioritize their software quality assurance efforts. However, the adoption of this prior work in practice remains low. In our work, we identify a set of challenges that need to be addressed to make previous work on quality assurance prioritization more pragmatic. We outline four guidelines that address these challenges to make prior work on software quality assurance more pragmatic: 1) Focused Granularity (i.e., small prioritization units), 2) Timely Feedback (i.e., results can be acted on in a timely fashion), 3) Estimate Effort (i.e., estimate the time it will take to complete tasks), and 4) Evaluate Generality (i.e., evaluate findings across multiple projects and multiple domains). We present two approaches, at the code and change level, that demonstrate how prior approaches can be more pragmatic. © 2011 Author.

# 51 - The fractal dimension metric and its use to assess object-oriented software quality

## Turnu I., Concas G., Marchesi M., Tonelli R.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79959820792&doi=10.1145%2f1985374.1985391&partnerID=40&md5=b5b6e37a0c9c5c579dc5012d4a9d2036

We present a study were software systems are considered as complex networks which have a self-similar structure under a length-scale transformation. On such complex software networks we computed a self-similar coefficient, also known as fractal dimension, using "the box counting method". We analyzed various releases of the publically available Eclipse software systems, calculating the fractal dimension for twenty sub-projects, randomly chosen, for every release, as well as for each release as a whole. Our results display an overall consistency among the sub-projects and among all the analyzed releases. We found a very good correlation between the fractal dimension and the number of bugs for Eclipse and for twenty sub-projects. Since the fractal dimension is just a scalar number that characterizes a whole system, while complexity and quality metrics are in general computed on every system module, this result suggests that the fractal dimension could be considered as a global quality metric for large software systems. Our results need however to be confirmed for other large software systems. © 2011 ACM.

In this keynote I explore what exactly do we mean by data quality, techniques to assess data quality and the very significant challenges that poor data quality can pose. I believe we neglect data quality at our peril since - whether we like it or not - our research results are founded upon data and our assumptions that data quality issues do not confound our results. A systematic review of the literature suggests that it is a minority practice to even explicitly discuss data quality. I therefore suggest that this topic should become a higher priority amongst empirical software engineering researchers. © 2011 ACM.

# 53 - A framework for evaluating quality-driven self-adaptive software systems

Over the past decade the dynamic capabilities of self-adaptive software-intensive systems have proliferated and improved significantly. To advance the field of self-adaptive and self-managing systems further and to leverage the benefits of self-adaptation, we need to develop methods and tools to assess and possibly certify adaptation properties of self-adaptive systems, not only at design time but also, and especially, at run-time. In this paper we propose a framework for evaluating quality-driven self-adaptive software systems. Our framework is based on a survey of self-adaptive system papers and a set of adaptation properties derived from control theory properties. We also establish a mapping between these properties and software quality attributes. Thus, corresponding software quality metrics can then be used to assess adaptation properties. © 2011 ACM.

# 54 - Conflict-centric software architectural views: Exposing trade-offs in quality requirements

## Savolainen J., Männistö T.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77958186171&doi=10.1109%2fMS.2010.139&partnerID=40&md5=9c5b83d4d132cc2a9bcd91093c9af365

Much work on software architectures has focused on how to document them. This has improved the understanding of real-life architectures. However, when multiple stakeholder concerns need to be addressed, they easily become scattered throughout the documentation. One reason might be that architectural views typically don't support the easy evaluation of trade-offs between conflicting quality attributes. When these concerns and related architectural decisions are distributed among many views, they are less obvious to architects and stakeholders. The authors propose an approach to creating architectural views that more prominently communicate the conflicts between key stakeholders' concerns. The approach also tends to reduce the amount of architectural documentation and thus increase its communication value by highlighting architectural decisions made to resolve the conflicts identified. © 2006 IEEE.

# 55 - An empirical analysis of team review approaches for teaching quality software development

Reviews are an integral part of the software development process. They are one of the key methodologies that undergraduates study in order to develop quality software. Despite their importance, reviews are rarely used in software engineering projects at the baccalaureate level. This paper demonstrates results from a study conducted on students at baccalaureate level enrolled in a one-semester software engineering course at the National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences - Foundation for Advancement of Science and Technology (NUCES-FAST) in Pakistan. The objectives of the study are: to determine how the various team review techniques help to educate students about the importance of the review process and find which technique is more suitable for teaching reviews to undergraduates. Two variations on team review are proposed: Similar Domain Review (SDR) and Cross-Domain Review (CDR) without author. The paper presents a comparison of the proposed and existing team review techniques and measures their effectiveness in terms of defect detection. The results show that the proposed variation SDR is more effective in defect detection than CDR (with/without author). Another interesting result is that the proposed CDR-without author is better than CDR with author (the existing team review approach). Also, early defect detection enabled students to incorporate changes and improve the software quality. © 2010 ACM.

With the prevalent application of multi-core CPUs, software practitioners are facing the challenge of developing high quality multi-threaded programs. Applying concurrency design patterns is one of the best practices in multi-core software engineering. We comprehensively surveyed 28 concurrency design patterns, and provided a problem-oriented guide that navigates software developers towards the "right" pattern(s) with minimal search/reading effort. The guide also illustrates the relationship between concurrency design patterns and the quality attributes they address. Additionally, further investigation was conducted on how these concurrency design patterns implement quality attributes tactics. We present a mapping between surveyed concurrency design patterns and the tactics for two important quality attributes: performance and modifiability. The results of these studies provide an insight into concurrency design patterns for software developers who are seeking appropriate or improved solutions to multi-threaded software development issues. © 2010 ACM.

# 57 - When process data quality affects the number of bugs: Correlations in software engineering datasets

Software engineering process information extracted from version control systems and bug tracking databases are widely used in empirical software engineering. In prior work, we showed that these data are plagued by quality deficiencies, which vary in its characteristics across projects. In addition, we showed that those deficiencies in the form of bias do impact the results of studies in empirical software engineering. While these findings affect software engineering researchers the impact on practitioners has not yet been substantiated. In this paper we, therefore, explore (i) if the process data quality and characteristics have an influence on the bug fixing process and (ii) if the process quality as measured by the process data has an influence on the product (i.e., software) quality. Specifically, we analyze six Open Source as well as two Closed Source projects and show that process data quality and characteristics have an impact on the bug fixing process: the high rate of empty commit messages in Eclipse, for example, correlates with the bug report quality. We also show that the product quality - measured by number of bugs reported - is affected by process data quality measures. These findings have the potential to prompt practitioners to increase the quality of their software process and its associated data quality. © 2010 IEEE.

# 58 - Quality specification and metrication, results from a case-study in a mission-critical software domain

## Trienekens J.J.M., Kusters R.J., Brussel D.C.

Software quality is of increasing importance in mission-critical embedded software systems. Due to the fast growing complexity and accompanying risks of failures of these systems, software quality needs to be addressed explicitly by software developers, preferably with a systematic method for an optimal implementation of software qualities, such as reliability, time-behavior and usability. At the Centre of Automation of Mission-critical Systems (CAMS) of the Dutch Royal Navy, a new approach has been defined for software developers to improve the way that they deal with software quality in the process of mission-critical systems engineering. The stepwise approach is based on both an international quality standard for software product quality, i.e. ISO9126, and on Multi-Criteria Decision Making techniques, i.e. analytical hierarchy process (AHP). The stepwise approach has been validated in a case study. In particular, the tailoring of the ISO9126 standard toward the specific CAMS development situation, and the applicability of AHP techniques, from the perspective of software developers, has been investigated. The case study is carried out in a representative software development project, i.e. the software for combat management systems (CMS) of warships. Results of the case study show that software developers can explicitly deal with quality on the basis of both the ISO9126 standard and the AHP techniques, respectively regarding the specification, prioritization and metrication of software product quality. © 2010 The Author(s).

With the rapid development of the software industry, improving the quality of software development has gained increasing importance. Software manufacturers have recently applied quality improvement techniques to software development to respond to the needs for software quality. Software quality function deployment (SQFD), as a technique for improving the quality of the software development process to create products responsive to customer expectations, is used to maximize customer satisfaction. This paper presents a fuzzy regression and optimization approach to determine target levels in SQFD. The inherent fuzziness of relationships in SQFD modeling justifies the use of fuzzy regression. Fuzzy regression is used to identify the functional relationships between customer requirements and technical attributes, and among technical attributes. Then, a mathematical programming model is developed to determine target levels of technical attributes using the functional relationships obtained by fuzzy regression. A search engine quality improvement problem is presented to illustrate the application of the proposed approach. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.
