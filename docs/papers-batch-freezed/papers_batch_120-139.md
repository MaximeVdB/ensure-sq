Specifying the quality of software products is a valuable addition to functional specification, clarifying product properties such as learnability and availability. Specifying such properties is considered difficult due to the different parties involved and the implicit nature of the requirements. The QUINT project gathered experience with product specification by means of the Extended ISO model: an extension to the ISO 9126 model of software quality. By defining indicators and specifying how they should be measured, quality specifications can make requirements explicit. Recommendations and pitfalls for composing a specification are grouped by the context in which quality specifications can be used. © 1996 Chapman & Hall.

Research is described, aimed to support traceability in the design of software for safety-critical applications, through the provision of an on-line design journal enabling design decisions and actions to be traced and recorded. The design environment, within which various software design tools may be encapsulated, enables protocol between the user and the design tools to be trapped. This provides software engineering support at the conceptual design stage. An important aim of the research is to enable inferences to be made from the captured protocol, for which the application of artificial intelligence methods is being investigated. © 1996 Chapman & Hall.

This paper presents the key findings of a survey of a representative sample of the Australian software industry as to the actual use and application of quality assurance techniques in the development of software. The survey aims to confirm previous survey findings through a management questionnaire and to investigate the software development practices at the 'screen face' through a developer questionnaire. The separate responses are analysed to rate the extent to which quality management practices have penetrated the information systems department. The project commenced in July 1994 and the results of this initial survey support the hypothesis that software quality assurance programmes have not yet penetrated to the systems developers at lower levels of organizations. © 1996 Chapman & Hall.

This paper has developed from the SoFEA project at The open University which is studying the non-technical aspects of quality in software. This involves seeing the technical elements of software development as very much part of a wider context. The culture of an organization as a whole, particularly its management strategies, are regarded as driving and shaping the technology. A particular challenge for management we have observed is how to harmonize a skilled individualist (affectionately dubbed a 'maverick') and a quality management system. We explore the characteristics of an individualist programmer and discuss the options for managing such a person. Some of the experiences of a scientific organization are reported. © 1996 Chapman & Hall.

# 124 - Software quality: the elusive target

High-profile disasters and the ensuing debates in the press are alerting more people to the crucial nature of software quality in their everyday lives. This should prompt software professionals to take a second look at how they define software quality. In this task of assessing 'adequate' quality in a software product, context is important. Errors tolerated in word-processing software may not be acceptable in control software for a nuclear power plant. Thus, the meanings of 'safety-critical' and 'mission-critical' must be reexamined in the context of software's contribution to the larger functionality and quality of products and businesses. At the same time, software professionals must ask themselves who is responsible for setting quality goals, and make sure they are achieved.

# 125 - The impact of software evolution and reuse on software quality

This paper presents a case study of a software project in the maintenance phase. The case study was based on a sample of modules, representing about 1.3 million lines of code, from a very large telecommunications system. Software quality models were developed to predict the number of faults expected from the coding through operations phases. Since modules from the prior release were often reused to develop a new release, one model incorporated reuse data as additional independent variables. We compare this model's performance to a similar model without reuse data. Software quality models often have product metrics as the only input data for predicting quality. There is an implicit assumption that all the modules have had a similar development history, so that product attributes are the primary drivers of different quality levels. Reuse of software as components and software evolution do not fit this assumption very well, and consequently, traditional models for such environments may not have adequate accuracy. Focusing on the software maintenance phase, this study demonstrated that reuse data can significantly improve the predictive accuracy of software quality models. © 1996 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

# 126 - Frameworks for quality software process: SEI Capability maturity model versus ISO 9000

## Saiedian H., Mcclanahan L.M.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0007663827&doi=10.1007%2fBF02420941&partnerID=40&md5=920d8525d6033e615724b4a8ab7ec770

With the historical characterization of software development as being costly due to massive schedule delays, incorporation of the ever-changing technology, budget reductions, and missing customer requirements, the trend of the 1990s in establishing a quality improvement or a quality assurance programme has been overwhelming. The two popular models or frameworks for assessment of a quality assurance programme are the US government-sponsored Capability Maturity Model (CMM) and the internationally recognized ISO-9000 quality standards. Both of these two frameworks share a common concern regarding software quality and process management. Since it is not clear which of these two frameworks is most effective in achieving their shared objectives, it is valuable and timely to provide an objective overview of both models and to compare and contrast their features for quality software development. Because there are many legitimate areas for comparison, we have selected the two most important as a basis for comparison: (1) the role of management, and (2) the application of measurements. We also provide a summary of the reported impact of these two models on the organizations adhering to their standards, and include our observations and analysis. © 1996 Chapman & Hall.

# 127 - Factors affecting the quality of software project management:an empirical study based on the Capability Maturity Model

## Mcguire E.G.

Rigorous project management can help raise a software product development process from an initial, immature stage that is unstable and unrepeatable to an optimized maturity level characterized by continuous improvement and innovation. Goals and actions related to a repeatable project management process have been outlined in the Capability Maturity Model (CMM) developed by the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. The CMM provides good guidelines for initiating software process improvement particularly in the project management area; however, the successful implementation of the CMM guidelines is often not accomplished without significant organizational change involving increased emphasis on change management, teams and employee empowerment. This paper is empirically based on observations, surveys, and interviews of project team managers and project team members in a large, multinational organization. The focus of the paper is on the development of a project management process that emphasizes project planning, change management, quality management, team work, and process control. Findings presented in this paper are correlated with the CMM guidelines as well as organizational factors that were found to enable or impede the successful deployment of various aspects of a project management improvement plan. The role of education and training in process and quality techniques as well as project management tools that support group work is also examined. This paper provides some insight into the issues faced by organizations based on traditional hierarchy or matrix management as they attempt to move into a more process-driven, quality-oriented development environment. As organizations move towards global markets they need increased emphasis on quality, value, teams, standards and global project management strategies based on structured guidelines to handle process Sow within and between projects, departments, organizations, and national boundaries. © 1996 Chapman & Hall.

Many software quality metrics to objectively grasp software products and process have been proposed in the past decades. In actual projects, quality metrics has been widely applied to manage software quality. However, there are still several problems with providing effective feedback to intermediate software products and the software development process. We have proposed a software quality management using quality metrics which are easily and automatically measured. The purpose of this proposal is to establish a method for building in software quality by regularly measuring and reviewing. This paper outlines a model for building in software quality using quality metrics, and describes examples of its application to actual projects and its results. As the results, it was found that quality metrics can be used to detect and remove problems with process and products in each phase. Regular technical reviews using quality metrics and information on the change of the regularly measured results was also found to have a positive influence on the structure and module size of programs. Further, in the test phase, it was found that with the proposed model, the progress of corrective action could be quickly and accurately grasped.

# 129 - Controlling and predicting the quality of space shuttle software using metrics

## Schneidewind N.F.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0343935307&doi=10.1007%2fBF00404649&partnerID=40&md5=b99281a03e36e4acaf4ca5067792314f

Software quality metrics have potential for helping to assure the quality of software on large projects such as the Space Shuttle flight software. It is feasible to validate metrics for controlling and predicting software quality during design by validating metrics against a quality factor. Quality factors, like reliability, are of more interest to customers than metrics, like complexity. However quality factors cannot be collected until late in a project. Therefore the need arises to validate metrics, which developers can collect early in a project, against a quality factor. We investigate the feasibility of validating metrics for controlling and predicting quality on the Space Shuttle. The key to the approach is the use of validated metrics for early identification and resolution of quality problems. © 1995 Chapman & Hall.

In this paper, we investigate how to incorporate program complexity measures with a software quality model. We collect software complexity metrics and fault counts from each build during the testing phase of a large commercial software system. Though the data are limited in quantity, we are able to predict the number of faults in the next build. The technique we used is called times series analysis and forecasting. The methodology assumes that future predictions are based on the history of past observations. We will show that the combined complexity quality model is an improvement over the simpler quality only model. Finally, we explore how the testing process used in this development may be improved by using these predictions and suggest areas for future research. © 1995 Chapman & Hall.

For the last seven years, Martin Griss and his colleagues have investigated how Hewlett-Packard can improve its software-development process using systematic software reuse. Griss has been a professor, research laboratory manager, and industrial researcher. Marty Wosser has worked closely with him on software reuse for four years. In this column, they share some of what HP has learned about software ware reuse. This column, which builds on a talk Griss delivered at the International Conference on Software Engineering last May, can help you manage expectations about what software reuse can and cannot deliver. - Shari Lawrence Pfleeger. © 1995, IEEE.

# 132 - Measurement as an alternative to bureaucracy for the achievement of software quality

## Neil M.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-1542478267&doi=10.1007%2fBF00213631&partnerID=40&md5=d7492a6bd3774989e38bb87ab5119d87

In this paper we discuss the two dominant modes of thought on the problem of software quality: the bureaucratic approach and the technical approach. The aim of the paper is to pursue the issues of how these approaches affect people, in our case software developers, and how we can assess the effectiveness of each approach in actually achieving quality software. An outline of the main aspects of the organizational approach - process modelling and software standards - is given. In order to address the effects of each of these modes of thought on people we take a psychological perspective. The implications for software engineering, in terms of formalism and mechanization, are discussed. The paper argues that overzealous structure, control and automation can negatively affect the creative process of developing software. A perspective on each of the components of the technical approach in terms of their effectiveness in achieving quality objectives is provided. From recent work we find that process modelling and many software standards do not provide an adequate assessment of the benefits derived from their application. The paper argues that measurement goes some way to addressing these problems. Measurement should form the core of the software development process, especially with respect to product quality assessment. The main conclusion is that by focusing on measurable objectives and results we can best achieve quality software products and highlight the processes which are likely to create them in a repeatable and manageable fashion. Additionally, by adopting measurement in practice we should expect to increase the freedom and creativity of software developers. © 1994 Chapman & Hall.

Formal technical review (FTR) is an essential component of all software quality assessment, assurance, and improvement techniques. However, current FTR practice leads to significant expense, clerical overhead, group process obstacles, and research methodology problems. CSRS is an instrumented, computer-supported cooperative work environment for formal technical review. CSRS addresses problems in the practice of FTR by providing computer support for both the process and products of FTR. CSRS also addresses problems in research on FTR through instrumentation supporting fine-grained, high quality data collection and analysis. This paper describes CSRS, a computer-mediated review method called FTArm, and selected findings from their use to explore issues in formal technical review.

The paper presents the findings of a survey that investigated the level of quality management practice within some 150 UK companies from a sample of 500. It provides a snapshot of practice at the time of the survey, and assesses the impact of government quality initiatives particularly, the TickIT scheme at that time. The survey methodology is described, together with the results and conclusions. The sample has been graded by size of company, which the authors consider to have a significant effect upon the adoption of quality practices. The survey highlights the need to encourage small companies to adopt quality practices and to assist them with the short-term costs incurred. © 1993 Chapman & Hall.

This paper describes the Ceilidh software quality control environment for the teaching of computer programming. Ceilidh provides students with an integrated environment for developing programs according to specifications and quality standards defined by the teacher. The student's programs are automatically assessed from a number of perspectives including dynamic correctness, program complexity and programming style. The assessment of programs is carried out according to well established software metrics and students may repeatedly re-assess their programs, enabling them gradually to work towards a quality target. The paper gives an overview of the functionality of Ceilidh followed by a more detailed description of the software metrics used. It also discusses some of the insights gained from several years' use at Nottingham. Finally, the paper outlines plans for the future development of Ceilidh including a pilot project involving 30 UK institutes of higher education funded under the Universities Funding Council's Teaching and Learning Technology Programme (TLTP). The paper should be of particular interest to anyone involved in teaching programming, whether it be in university, in schools or in industry, who might wish to construct a similar system or who might wish to obtain and use Ceilidh directly. It should also be of interest to those looking for experiences gained from large-scale applications of software quality metrics. © 1993 Chapman & Hall.

The software created by industrial, educational, and research organizations is increasingly large and complex. It also occupies a central role in the reliability and safety of many essential services. We examine the software development process and suggest opportunities for improving the process by using a combination of statistical and other process control techniques. Data, analysis of data, and tools for collecting data are crucial to our approach. Though our views are based upon experiences with large telecommunications systems, they are likely to be useful to many other developers of large software systems.

With the current worldwide focus on improvement in software process, there is clearly a need for an understanding of its impact on software engineering productivity and quality. This paper documents an attempt to provide an empirical metrics ″view″ of such initiatives based on data collected in a worldwide benchmarking effort conducted between March, 1991 and December, 1991. Surprisingly, of the more than 300 organizations that participated, fewer than 1 in 5 had any quantifiable performance data available prior to the start of this study. However, those that had embarked on significant process improvement efforts and were actively using metrics were able to demonstrate substantial gains in productivity and quality. In addition, insights derived from this large scale data analysis provide a framework for determining which metrics should be included in a standard software engineering measurement 'dashboard'.
