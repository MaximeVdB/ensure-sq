Software quality is recognized as being very significant for achieving competitiveness in the software industry, so improvements in this area are gaining increasing importance. Software quality improvements can only be achieved by managing all of the factors that influence it. However, in a real business system, there are a great number of factors impacting software quality, while the processes are stochastic and resources are limited, so economic data should also be taken into consideration. This paper uses a Markov chain and proposes a systematic framework for modelling the stochastic processes of a quality management system and selection of the optimum set of factors impacting software quality. A methodology is presented for managing the factors that affect software quality with an illustrative hypothetical example for convenience of application of the proposed methodology. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85026633467&doi=10.1145%2f2889160.2891049&partnerID=40&md5=6d99ef500aabca2de5eabfb37df2b2d4

This Technical Briefing describes the nature of Software Qualities (SQs), ilities, or non-functional requirements (reliability, usability, affordability, etc.), and discusses the importance of understanding their nature and interrelationships, and of bringing them into balance in the practice of software engineering. The relevance and timeliness of this topic reflects the current and future trends toward more software-intensive systems, with greater complexity, autonomy, speed of change, and need for interoperability within systems of systems, given the frequent system shortfalls and overruns that occur when their SQ balance is not achieved. It discusses the weaknesses of current SQ standards and guidance, and summarizes research toward strengthening current SQ definitions and relationships. This includes a set of initial SQ ontology elements and relationships, examples of their application to some key SQs, an identification of further research and development needed to make the ontology fully useful and evolvable, and the nature of an international collaborative effort to help improve current practices via a Qualipedia for accessing the evolving body of knowledge for improving SQ engineering. © 2016 Author.

# 22 - Cognitive biases in software quality and testing

## Salman I.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018633964&doi=10.1145%2f2889160.2889265&partnerID=40&md5=2e6ecd5166fb1360d1af9f67d9b1d1f9

Humans are an integral entity for performing software quality and testing activities. The quality is compromised when human-thought process deviates from the laws of rational thinking, referred to as cognitive biases. The work carried out so far from this perspective in software quality and testing is very scarce and is limited to one cognitive bias only. This work aims to explore the phenomenon of cognitive biases in software quality and testing in more detail. Furthermore, investigating the factors that exist in an organisational context and that trigger the biases, which in turn deteriorate the quality of software, is also the focus of this work. Acquiring the knowledge of cognitive biases and the triggering factors will help in circumventing them, thus improving software quality. © 2016 ACM.

# 23 - Revisiting code ownership and its relationship with software quality in the scope of modern code review

## Thongtanunam P., McIntosh S., Hassan A.E., Iida H.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84971482984&doi=10.1145%2f2884781.2884852&partnerID=40&md5=0c2da8fa587f2d260b605b676b5a2c31

Code ownership establishes a chain of responsibility for modules in large software systems. Although prior work uncovers a link between code ownership heuristics and software quality, these heuristics rely solely on the authorship of code changes. In addition to authoring code changes, developers also make important contributions to a module by reviewing code changes. Indeed, recent work shows that reviewers are highly active in modern code review processes, often suggesting alternative solutions or providing updates to the code changes. In this paper, we complement traditional code ownership heuristics using code review activity. Through a case study of six releases of the large Qt and OpenStack systems, we find that: (1) 67%-86% of developers did not author any code changes for a module, but still actively contributed by reviewing 21%-39% of the code changes, (2) code ownership heuristics that are aware of reviewing activity share a relationship with software quality, and (3) the proportion of reviewers without expertise shares a strong, increasing relationship with the likelihood of having post-release defects. Our results suggest that reviewing activity captures an important aspect of code ownership, and should be included in approximations of it in future studies. © 2016 ACM.

# 24 - A practical guide to select quality indicators for assessing pareto-based search algorithms in search-based software engineering

## Wang S., Ali S., Yue T., Li Y., Liaaen M.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84971412816&doi=10.1145%2f2884781.2884880&partnerID=40&md5=fb106f940fea5f845deddb5ac287de81

Many software engineering problems are multi-objective in nature, which has been largely recognized by the Search-based Software Engineering (SBSE) community. In this regard, Paretobased search algorithms, e.g., Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II, have already shown good performance for solving multi-objective optimization problems. These algorithms produce Pareto fronts, where each Pareto front consists of a set of nondominated solutions. Eventually, a user selects one or more of the solutions from a Pareto front for their specific problems. A key challenge of applying Pareto-based search algorithms is to select appropriate quality indicators, e.g., hypervolume, to assess the quality of Pareto fronts. Based on the results of an extended literature review, we found that the current literature and practice in SBSE lacks a practical guide for selecting quality indicators despite a large number of published SBSE works. In this direction, the paper presents a practical guide for the SBSE community to select quality indicators for assessing Pareto-based search algorithms in different software engineering contexts. The practical guide is derived from the following complementary theoretical and empirical methods: 1) key theoretical foundations of quality indicators; 2) evidence from an extended literature review; and 3) evidence collected from an extensive experiment that was conducted to evaluate eight quality indicators from four different categories with six Pareto-based search algorithms using three real industrial problems from two diverse domains. © 2016 ACM.

# 25 - An experience-based framework for evaluating alignment of software quality goals

## Chatzipetrou P., Angelis L., Barney S., Wohlin C.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85028193608&doi=10.1007%2fs11219-014-9251-5&partnerID=40&md5=dbcf765656760d5ef5d16996f0b82b9f

Efficient quality management of software projects requires knowledge of how various groups of stakeholders involved in software development prioritize the product and project goals. Agreements or disagreements among members of a team may originate from inherent groupings, depending on various professional or other characteristics. These agreements are not easily detected by conventional practices (discussions, meetings, etc.) since the natural language expressions are often obscuring, subjective, and prone to misunderstandings. It is therefore essential to have objective tools that can measure the alignment among the members of a team; especially critical for the software development is the degree of alignment with respect to the prioritization goals of the software product. The paper proposes an experience-based framework of statistical and graphical techniques for the systematic study of prioritization alignment, such as hierarchical cluster analysis, analysis of cluster composition, correlation analysis, and closest agreement-directed graph. This framework can provide a thorough and global picture of a team’s prioritization perspective and can potentially aid managerial decisions regarding team composition and leadership. The framework is applied and illustrated in a study related to global software development where 65 individuals in different roles, geographic locations and professional relationships with a company, prioritize 24 goals from individual perception of the actual situation and for an ideal situation. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

# 26 - Handover of managerial responsibilities in global software development: a case study of source code evolution and quality

## Jabangwe R., Börstler J., Petersen K.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84944511169&doi=10.1007%2fs11219-014-9247-1&partnerID=40&md5=ca9b6b9aefe9dfad177d3fb3e573f0c5

Studies report on the negative effect on quality in global software development (GSD) due to communication and coordination-related challenges. However, empirical studies reporting on the magnitude of the effect are scarce. This paper presents findings from an embedded explanatory case study on the change in quality over time, across multiple releases, for products that were developed in a GSD setting. The GSD setting involved periods of distributed development between geographically dispersed sites as well as a handover of project management responsibilities between the involved sites. Investigations were performed on two medium-sized products from a company that is part of a large multinational corporation. Quality is investigated quantitatively using defect data and measures that quantify two source code properties, size and complexity. Observations were triangulated with subjective views from company representatives. There were no observable indications that the distribution of work or handover of project management responsibilities had an impact on quality on both products. Among the product-, process- and people-related success factors, we identified well-designed product architectures, early handover planning and support from the sending site to the receiving site after the handover and skilled employees at the involved sites. Overall, these results can be useful input for decision-makers who are considering distributing development work between globally dispersed sites or handing over project management responsibilities from one site to another. Moreover, our study shows that analyzing the evolution of size and complexity properties of a product’s source code can provide valuable information to support decision-making during similar projects. Finally, the strategy used by the company to relocate responsibilities can also be considered as an alternative for software transfers, which have been linked with a decline in efficiency, productivity and quality. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

How can organizational factors such as structure and culture have an impact on the working conditions of developers? This study is based on ten months of observation of an in-house software development project within a large telecommunications company. The observation was conducted during mandatory weekly status meetings, where technical and managerial issues were raised and discussed. Preliminary results show that many decisions made under the pressure of certain organizational factors negatively affected software quality. This paper describes cases depicting the complexity of organizational factors and reports on ten issues that have had a negative impact on quality, followed by suggested avenues for corrective action. © 2015 IEEE.

# 30 - A quality cost reduction model for large-scale software development

## Galinac Grbac T., Car Ž., Huljenić D.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84925839331&doi=10.1007%2fs11219-014-9240-8&partnerID=40&md5=c1098d690d854415c6385a80aad0b3a6

Understanding quality costs is recognized as a prerequisite for decreasing the variability of the success of software development projects. This paper presents an empirical quality cost reduction (QCR) model to support the decision-making process for additional investment in the early phases of software verification. The main idea of the QCR model is to direct additional investment into software units that have some fault-slip potential in their later verification phases, with the aim of reducing costs and increasing product quality. The fault-slip potential of a software unit within a system is determined by analogy with historical projects. After a preliminary study on a sample of software units, which proves that we can lower quality costs with additional investment into particular verification activities, we examine the effectiveness of the proposed QCR model using real project data. The results show that applying the model produces a positive business case, meaning that the model lowers quality costs and increases quality, resulting in economic benefit. The potential to reduce quality costs is growing significantly with the evolution of software systems and the reuse of their software units. The proposed model is the result of a research project performed at Ericsson. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

# 31 - Understanding the impact of rapid releases on software quality: The case of firefox

## Khomh F., Adams B., Dhaliwal T., Zou Y.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84928707650&doi=10.1007%2fs10664-014-9308-x&partnerID=40&md5=21208201add0e79aae5c43c95cf46dcf

Many software companies are shifting from the traditional multi-month release cycle to shorter release cycles. For example, Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox release new versions every 6 weeks. These shorter release cycles reduce the users’ waiting time for a new release and offer better feedback and marketing opportunities to companies, but it is unclear if the quality of the software product improves as well, since developers and testers are under more pressure. In this paper, we extend our previous empirical study of Mozilla Firefox on the impact of rapid releases on quality assurance with feedback by Mozilla project members. The study compares crash rates, median uptime, and the proportion of pre- and post-release bugs in traditional releases with those in rapid releases, and we also analyze the source code changes made by developers to identify potential changes in the development process. We found that (1) with shorter release cycles, users do not experience significantly more pre- or post-release bugs (percentage-wise) and (2) bugs are fixed faster, yet (3) users experience these bugs earlier during software execution (the program crashes earlier). Increased integration activity and propagation of harder bugs to later versions account for some of these findings. Overall, our case study suggests that a clear release engineering process with thorough automation is one of the major challenges when switching to rapid releases. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

# 32 - Studying the relationship between logging characteristics and the code quality of platform software

## Shang W., Nagappan M., Hassan A.E.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84922001381&doi=10.1007%2fs10664-013-9274-8&partnerID=40&md5=3e2698304867833acfe9c475bacdcf9f

Platform software plays an important role in speeding up the development of large scale applications. Such platforms provide functionalities and abstraction on which applications can be rapidly developed and easily deployed. Hadoop and JBoss are examples of popular open source platform software. Such platform software generate logs to assist operators in monitoring the applications that run on them. These logs capture the doubts, concerns, and needs of developers and operators of platform software. We believe that such logs can be used to better understand code quality. However, logging characteristics and their relation to quality has never been explored. In this paper, we sought to empirically study this relation through a case study on four releases of Hadoop and JBoss. Our findings show that files with logging statements have higher post-release defect densities than those without logging statements in 7 out of 8 studied releases. Inspired by prior studies on code quality, we defined log-related product metrics, such as the number of log lines in a file, and log-related process metrics such as the number of changed log lines. We find that the correlations between our log-related metrics and post-release defects are as strong as their correlations with traditional process metrics, such as the number of pre-release defects, which is known to be one the metrics with the strongest correlation with post-release defects. We also find that log-related metrics can complement traditional product and process metrics resulting in up to 40 % improvement in explanatory power of defect proneness. Our results show that logging characteristics provide strong indicators of defect-prone source code files. However, we note that removing logs is not the answer to better code quality. Instead, our results show that it might be the case that developers often relay their concerns about a piece of code through logs. Hence, code quality improvement efforts (e.g., testing and inspection) should focus more on the source code files with large amounts of logs or with large amounts of log churn. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

# 33 - Effective quality management: Value- and risk-based software quality management

## Poth A., Sunyaev A.

Software quality management (SQM) must effectively deploy resources for quality assurance activities to reflect the achieved product quality. So, quality managers should exploit their creative freedom to direct their courses of action within the economic constraints. Effective Quality Management can increase SQM effectiveness. This value- and risk-based method is applicable for software developers, their customers, and users. This is due to its product function orientation and the independence of the software development procedures. © 1984-2012 IEEE.

# 34 - Introduction of static quality analysis in small- and medium-sized software enterprises: experiences from technology transfer

## Gleirscher M., Golubitskiy D., Irlbeck M., Wagner S.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84927804487&doi=10.1007%2fs11219-013-9217-z&partnerID=40&md5=96b5166ac6f386a4db36845b014b836d

Today, small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the software industry face major challenges. Their resource constraints require high efficiency in development. Furthermore, quality assurance (QA) measures need to be taken to mitigate the risk of additional, expensive effort for bug fixes or compensations. Automated static analysis (ASA) can reduce this risk because it promises low application effort. SMEs seem to take little advantage of this opportunity. Instead, they still mainly rely on the dynamic analysis approach of software testing. In this article, we report on our experiences from a technology transfer project. Our aim was to evaluate the results static analysis can provide for SMEs as well as the problems that occur when introducing and using static analysis in SMEs. We analysed five software projects from five collaborating SMEs using three different ASA techniques: code clone detection, bug pattern detection and architecture conformance analysis. Following the analysis, we applied a quality model to aggregate and evaluate the results. Our study shows that the effort required to introduce ASA techniques in SMEs is small (mostly below one person-hour each). Furthermore, we encountered only few technical problems. By means of the analyses, we could detect multiple defects in production code. The participating companies perceived the analysis results to be a helpful addition to their current QA and will include the analyses in their QA process. With the help of the Quamoco quality model, we could efficiently aggregate and rate static analysis results. However, we also encountered a partial mismatch with the opinions of the SMEs. We conclude that ASA and quality models can be a valuable and affordable addition to the QA process of SMEs. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013.

# 35 - Quality attribute modeling and quality aware product configuration in software product lines

## Zhang G., Ye H., Lin Y.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84875049200&doi=10.1007%2fs11219-013-9197-z&partnerID=40&md5=ad822ef7f6b285eb153f76658a503708

In software product line engineering, the customers mostly concentrate on the functionalities of the target product during product configuration. The quality attributes of a target product, such as security and performance, are often assessed until the final product is generated. However, it might be very costly to fix the problem if it is found that the generated product cannot satisfy the customers’ quality requirements. Although the quality of a generated product will be affected by all the life cycles of product development, feature-based product configuration is the first stage where the estimation or prediction of the quality attributes should be considered. As we know, the key issue of predicting the quality attributes for a product configured from feature models is to measure the interdependencies between functional features and quality attributes. The current existing approaches have several limitations on this issue, such as requiring real products for the measurement or involving domain experts’ efforts. To overcome these limitations, we propose a systematic approach of modeling quality attributes in feature models based on domain experts’ judgments using the analytic hierarchical process (AHP) and conducting quality aware product configuration based on the captured quality knowledge. Domain experts’ judgments are adapted to avoid generating the real products for quality evaluation, and AHP is used to reduce domain experts’ efforts involved in the judgments. A prototype tool is developed to implement the concepts of the proposed approach, and a formal evaluation is carried out based on a large-scale case study. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

# 37 - A framework for prioritization of quality requirements for inclusion in a software project

## Thakurta R.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84883450871&doi=10.1007%2fs11219-012-9188-5&partnerID=40&md5=cd6f505b77e01c4b9a0c58ebce43ccf2

Non-functional requirements (NFRs) determine the characteristics of a software product or service as a whole. The research described in this paper presents a quantitative framework involving respondents of both the project and the business organization, in order to determine the priority of a list of NFRs to be considered for implementation during a software development. The framework also provides a quantitative basis for evaluating the extent of value addition that can be achieved while deciding upon whether or not to consider a particular non-functional requirement for inclusion to the project's requirement set. The assessment process also indicates the extent to which different business values are perceived important by representatives of business organizations, and their perception of the importance of the different NFRs. The work distinguishes from others by explicitly considering dependencies among NFRs in the evaluation process. The final results are expected to be beneficial to both the business and the project organization by identifying and implementing the desired NFRs that contribute to business value in a cost-effective manner. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

# 38 - Studying the effect of co-change dispersion on software quality

Software change history plays an important role in measuring software quality and predicting defects. Co-change metrics such as number of files changed together has been used as a predictor of bugs. In this study, we further investigate the impact of specific characteristics of co-change dispersion on software quality. Using statistical regression models we show that co-changes that include files from different subsystems result in more bugs than co-changes that include files only from the same subsystem. This can be used to improve bug prediction models based on co-changes. © 2013 IEEE.

# 39 - MIDAS: A design quality assessment method for industrial software

## Samarthyam G., Suryanarayana G., Sharma T., Gupta S.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84886396370&doi=10.1109%2fICSE.2013.6606640&partnerID=40&md5=ad0d81ee2973d5ee478e587bb1b55aa5

Siemens Corporate Development Center Asia Australia (CT DC AA) develops and maintains software applications for the Industry, Energy, Healthcare, and Infrastructure & Cities sectors of Siemens. The critical nature of these applications necessitates a high level of software design quality. A survey of software architects indicated a low level of satisfaction with existing design assessment practices in CT DC AA and highlighted several shortcomings of existing practices. To address this, we have developed a design assessment method called MIDAS (Method for Intensive Design ASsessments). MIDAS is an expert-based method wherein manual assessment of design quality by experts is directed by the systematic application of design analysis tools through the use of a three view-model consisting of design principles, project-specific constraints, and an 'ility'-based quality model. In this paper, we describe the motivation for MIDAS, its design, and its application to three projects in CT DC AA. We believe that the insights from our MIDAS experience not only provide useful pointers to other organizations and practitioners looking to assess and improve software design quality but also suggest research questions for the software engineering community to explore. © 2013 IEEE.
