Agile methods can deliver software that fulfills customer needs rapidly and continuously. Quality requirements (QRs) are important in this regard; however, detailed studies on how companies applying agile methods to manage QRs are limited, as are studies on the rationale for choosing specific QR management practices and related challenges. The aim of this study was to address why practitioners manage QRs as they do and what challenges they face. We also analyzed how existing practices mitigate some of the found challenges. Lastly, we connect the contextual elements of the companies with their practices and challenges. We conducted 36 interviews with practitioners from four companies of varying sizes. Since each company operates in different domains, comparing QR management strategies and related challenges in different contexts was possible. We found that the companies apply proactive, reactive, and interactive strategies to manage QRs. Additionally, our study revealed 40 challenges in six categories that companies applying agile methods may face in QR management. We also identified nine contextual elements that affect QR management practice choices and which, importantly, can explain many related challenges. Based on these findings, we constructed a theoretical model about the connection between context, QR management practices, and challenges. Practitioners in similar contexts can learn from the practices identified in this study. Our preliminary theoretical model can help other practitioners identify what challenges they can expect to face in QR management in different developmental contexts as well as which practices to apply to mitigate these challenges. © 2021, The Author(s).

# 1 - The Relation of Test-Related Factors to Software Quality: A Case Study on Apache Systems

## Pecorelli F., Palomba F., De Lucia A.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85101418276&doi=10.1007%2fs10664-020-09891-y&partnerID=40&md5=d7bb069057ccf0279332887fd7b9e31a

Testing represents a crucial activity to ensure software quality. Recent studies have shown that test-related factors (e.g., code coverage) can be reliable predictors of software code quality, as measured by post-release defects. While these studies provided initial compelling evidence on the relation between tests and post-release defects, they considered different test-related factors separately: as a consequence, there is still a lack of knowledge of whether these factors are still good predictors when considering all together. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive case study on how test-related factors relate to production code quality in Apache systems. We first investigated how the presence of tests relates to post-release defects; then, we analyzed the role played by the test-related factors previously shown as significantly related to post-release defects. The key findings of the study show that, when controlling for other metrics (e.g., size of the production class), test-related factors have a limited connection to post-release defects. © 2021, The Author(s).

# 2 - A longitudinal study of static analysis warning evolution and the effects of PMD on software quality in Apache open source projects

## Trautsch A., Herbold S., Grabowski J.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85091245352&doi=10.1007%2fs10664-020-09880-1&partnerID=40&md5=077dac4a9230c050eb6b28ff2c596d4c

Automated static analysis tools (ASATs) have become a major part of the software development workflow. Acting on the generated warnings, i.e., changing the code indicated in the warning, should be part of, at latest, the code review phase. Despite this being a best practice in software development, there is still a lack of empirical research regarding the usage of ASATs in the wild. In this work, we want to study ASAT warning trends in software via the example of PMD as an ASAT and its usage in open source projects. We analyzed the commit history of 54 projects (with 112,266 commits in total), taking into account 193 PMD rules and 61 PMD releases. We investigate trends of ASAT warnings over up to 17 years for the selected study subjects regarding changes of warning types, short and long term impact of ASAT use, and changes in warning severities. We found that large global changes in ASAT warnings are mostly due to coding style changes regarding braces and naming conventions. We also found that, surprisingly, the influence of the presence of PMD in the build process of the project on warning removal trends for the number of warnings per lines of code is small and not statistically significant. Regardless, if we consider defect density as a proxy for external quality, we see a positive effect if PMD is present in the build configuration of our study subjects. © 2020, The Author(s).

We learned from the history of software that great software are theones who manage to sustain their quality. Free and open sourcesoftware (FOSS) has become a serious software supply channel.However, trust on FOSS products is still an issue. Quality is a traitthat enhances trust. In my study, I investigate the following question: how do FOSS communities sustain their software quality? Iargue that human and social factors contribute to the sustainabilityof quality in FOSS communities. Amongst these factors are: themotivation of participants, robust governance style for the software change process, and the exercise of good practices in the pullrequests evaluation process. © 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

# 4 - An empirical study of teaching qualities of popular computer science and software engineering instructors using RateMyProfessor.com data

## Kavalchuk A., Goldenberg A., Hussain I.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85093651824&doi=10.1145%2f3377814.3381700&partnerID=40&md5=548f17e80886b8cef5906827f72cb85a

The employment opportunity for Computer Science (CS), Information Technology and Software Engineering and Development (SE) related occupations is projected to grow much faster than the average of all other occupations. Therefore, increase in student enrollment, retention and graduation rate is becoming very important, so is the need for effective teaching in these subjects. Many universities commonly use formal, institutional Student Evaluation of Teaching (SET) systems to measure the teaching effectiveness. After each semester, through SET, students provide feedback and comments for their courses and instructors. However, evaluations are private and only a handful people have access to these. Therefore, these evaluations cannot be utilized to create a common understanding of the students' expectations, perspective, desired characteristics of the courses and instructors. On the other hand, third party online platforms like RateMyProfessor.com (RMP) are public, solicit anonymous student feedback and host tremendous amount of data about the instructors and their courses. These platforms are also popular among students. We mined and analyzed the RMP data for some research questions, e.g.: What are the common characteristics of the popular CS instructors? How different are they for the SE instructors? Are there any examples of special characteristics, tools and techniques popular CS instructors use? We captured and analyzed more than 9,000 students' comments for over 300 CS instructors for the top 20 universities in the U.S. and Canada. The paper contributes by presenting the findings for the research questions and making the data and the scripts available for public use for future research. © 2020 IEEE Computer Society.

# 5 - Deriving a usage-independent software quality metric

## Dey T., Mockus A.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85079758011&doi=10.1007%2fs10664-019-09791-w&partnerID=40&md5=6305e781914a82218ae0b82161c1ec56

Context: The extent of post-release use of software affects the number of faults, thus biasing quality metrics and adversely affecting associated decisions. The proprietary nature of usage data limited deeper exploration of this subject in the past. Objective: To determine how software faults and software use are related and how, based on that, an accurate quality measure can be designed. Method: Via Google Analytics we measure new users, usage intensity, usage frequency, exceptions, and release date and duration for complex proprietary mobile applications for Android and iOS. We utilize Bayesian Network and Random Forest models to explain the interrelationships and to derive the usage independent release quality measure. To increase external validity, we also investigate the interrelationship among various code complexity measures, usage (downloads), and number of issues for 520 NPM packages. We derived a usage-independent quality measure from these analyses, and applied it on 4430 popular NPM packages to construct timelines for comparing the perceived quality (number of issues) and our derived measure of quality during the lifetime of these packages. Results: We found the number of new users to be the primary factor determining the number of exceptions, and found no direct link between the intensity and frequency of software usage and software faults. Crashes increased with the power of 1.02-1.04 of new user for the Android app and power of 1.6 for the iOS app. Release quality expressed as crashes per user was independent of other usage-related predictors, thus serving as a usage independent measure of software quality. Usage also affected quality in NPM, where downloads were strongly associated with numbers of issues, even after taking the other code complexity measures into consideration. Unlike in mobile case where exceptions per user decrease over time, for 45.8% of the NPM packages the number of issues per download increase. Conclusions: We expect our result and our proposed quality measure will help gauge release quality of a software more accurately and inspire further research in this area. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

# 6 - An empirical investigation into merge conflicts and their effect on software quality

## Brindescu C., Ahmed I., Jensen C., Sarma A.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85072196973&doi=10.1007%2fs10664-019-09735-4&partnerID=40&md5=1f8c97f2452902a4690b4cd97cb910a9

Merge conflicts are known to cause extra effort for developers, but little is known about their effect on software. While some research has been done, many questions remain. To better understand merge conflicts and their impact we performed an empirical study about the types, frequency, and impact of merge conflicts, where impact is measured in terms of bug fixing commits associated with conflicts. We analyzed 143 open source projects and found that almost 1 in 5 merges cause conflicts. In 75.23% of these cases, a developer needed to reflect on the program logic to resolve it. We also found that the code associated with a merge conflict is twice as likely to have a bug. When the code associated with merge conflicts require manual intervention, the code is 26× more likely to have a bug. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

# 7 - How does developer interaction relate to software quality? an examination of product development data

## Datta S.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85026823677&doi=10.1007%2fs10664-017-9534-0&partnerID=40&md5=1bcbb3493632b82239aeb55703852b5f

Industrial software systems are being increasingly developed by large and distributed teams. Tools like collaborative development environments (CDE) are used to facilitate interaction between members of such teams, with the expectation that social factors around the interaction would facilitate team functioning. In this paper, we first identify typically social characteristics of interaction in a software development team: reachability, connection, association, and clustering. We then examine how these factors relate to the quality of software produced by a team, in terms of the number of defects, through an empirical study of 70+ teams, involving 900+ developers in total, spread across 30+ locations and 19 time-zones, working on 40,000+ units of work in the multi-version development of a major industrial product, spreading across more than five years. After controlling for known factors affecting large scale distributed development such as dependency, system age, developer expertise and experience, geographic dispersion, socio-technical congruence, and the number of files changed, we find statistically significant effects of connection and clustering on software quality. Higher levels of intra-team connection are found to relate to higher defect count, whereas more clustering relates to fewer defects. We examine the implications of these results for individual developers, project managers, and organizations. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

# 8 - Recognising object-oriented software design quality: a practitioner-based questionnaire survey

## Stevenson J., Wood M.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85017566671&doi=10.1007%2fs11219-017-9364-8&partnerID=40&md5=64be91384347ff392179346f104c31a8

Design quality is vital if software is to be maintainable. What practices do developers actually use to achieve design quality in their day-to-day work and which of these do they find most useful? To discover the extent to which practitioners concern themselves with object-oriented design quality and the approaches used when determining quality in practice, a questionnaire survey of 102 software practitioners, approximately half from the UK and the remainder from elsewhere around the world was used. Individual and peer experience are major contributors to design quality. Classic design guidelines, well-known lower level practices, tools and metrics all can also contribute positively to design quality. There is a potential relationship between testing practices and design quality. Inexperience, time pressures, novel problems, novel technology, and imprecise or changing requirements may have a negative impact on quality. Respondents with most experience are more confident in their design decisions, place more value on reviews by team leads and are more likely to rate design quality as very important. For practitioners, these results identify the techniques and tools that other practitioners find effective. For researchers, the results highlight a need for more work investigating the role of experience in the design process and the contribution experience makes to quality. There is also the potential for more in-depth studies of how practitioners are actually using design guidance, including Clean Code. Lastly, the potential relationship between testing practices and design quality merits further investigation. © 2017, The Author(s).

# 9 - Integrating software quality models into risk-based testing

## Foidl H., Felderer M.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84994719172&doi=10.1007%2fs11219-016-9345-3&partnerID=40&md5=08aef64094ee176e3efa77d89641d4fa

Risk-based testing is a frequently used testing approach which utilizes identified risks of a software system to provide decision support in all phases of the testing process. Risk assessment, which is a core activity of every risk-based testing process, is often done in an ad hoc manual way. Software quality assessments, based on quality models, already describe the product-related risks of a whole software product and provide objective and automation-supported assessments. But so far, quality models have not been applied for risk assessment and risk-based testing in a systematic way. This article tries to fill this gap and investigates how the information and data of a quality assessment based on the open quality model QuaMoCo can be integrated into risk-based testing. We first present two generic approaches showing how quality assessments based on quality models can be integrated into risk-based testing and then provide the concrete integration on the basis of the open quality model QuaMoCo. Based on five open source products, a case study is performed. Results of the case study show that a risk-based testing strategy outperforms a lines of code-based testing strategy with regard to the number of defects detected. Moreover, a significant positive relationship between the risk coefficient and the associated number of defects was found. © 2016, The Author(s).

# 10 - Challenges of software process and product quality improvement: catalyzing defect root-cause investigation by process enactment data analysis

## Söylemez M., Tarhan A.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84983535140&doi=10.1007%2fs11219-016-9334-6&partnerID=40&md5=84cd45d8183f9bbdab5d4fa837c0120e

It is claimed by software quality management that the quality of a software product is highly influenced by the quality of the software process followed to develop it. Since measurement of the software process is a challenging task, it is frequently the defects in the software product that are used to measure development quality. By extracting semantic information from defect records, practitioners can investigate and address root causes of software defects to improve development process and product quality. Investigating root causes requires effort for a detailed analysis into the components of the development process that originated the software defects, and is therefore encouraged only at higher maturity levels by most known process improvement models such as Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI). This practice, however, postpones the benefits that root-cause analysis would bring in gaining process awareness to improve the software development process and product quality in emergent organizations or organizations residing at lower maturity levels (MLs). In this article, we present a method for and results from applying root-cause analysis for software defects recorded in a software-intensive project of a CMMI ML3 certified institute. The suggested method combines process enactment data collection and analysis with Orthogonal Defect Classification which is a known technique in defect root-cause analysis. Prior to and after implementing the method in the study, defect attributes were analyzed and compared in order to understand any improvements in development performance and product quality. The results of the comparison indicate that the suggested method was efficient in the effort it required and effective in improving development performance and product quality. Defect triggers have become more active in identifying software defects in the earlier phases of software development, and the cost of quality due to software defects has decreased in consequence. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

# 11 - Software quality through the eyes of the end-user and static analysis tools: A study on Android OSS applications

## Srisopha K., Alfayez R.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85051522416&doi=10.1145%2f3194095.3194096&partnerID=40&md5=7a9dc5d4116e134e2a85128cb3328d90

Source code analysis tools have been the vehicle for measuring and assessing the quality of a software product for decades. However, recently many studies have shown that post-deployment end-user reviews provide a wealth of insight into the quality of a software product and how it should evolve and be maintained. For example, end-user reviews help to identify missing features or inform developers about incorrect or unexpected software behavior. We believe that analyzing end-user reviews and utilizing analysis tools are a crucial step towards understanding the complete picture of the quality of a software product, as well as towards reasoning about the evolution history of it. In this paper, we investigate whether both methods correlate with one another. In other words, we explore if there exists a relationship between user satisfaction and the application's internal quality characteristics. To conduct our research, we analyze a total of 46 actual releases of three Android open source software (OSS) applications on the Google Play Store. For each release, we employ multiple static analysis tools to assess several aspects of the application's software quality. We retrieve and manually analyze the complete reviews after each release of each application from its store page, totaling 1004 reviews. Our initial results suggest that having high or low code quality does not necessary ensure user overall satisfaction. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

# 12 - Quality Assurance of Bioinformatics Software: A Case Study of Testing a Biomedical Text Processing Tool Using Metamorphic Testing

## Srinivasan M., Shahri M.P., Kahanda I., Kanewala U.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85051246822&doi=10.1145%2f3193977.3193981&partnerID=40&md5=13df9dbdd437caf62d8e1450305f47c6

Bioinformatics software plays a very important role in making critical decisions within many areas including medicine and health care. However, most of the research is directed towards developing tools, and little time and effort is spent on testing the software to assure its quality. In testing, a test oracle is used to determine whether a test is passed or failed during testing, and unfortunately, for much of bioinformatics software, the exact expected outcomes are not well defined. Thus, the main challenge associated with conducting systematic testing on bioinformatics software is the oracle problem. Metamorphic testing (MT) is a technique used to test programs that face the oracle problem. MT uses metamorphic relations (MRs) to determine whether a test has passed or failed and specifies how the output should change according to a specific change made to the input. In this work, we use MT to test LingPipe, a tool for processing text using computational linguistics, often used in bioinformatics for bio-entity recognition from biomedical literature. First, we identify a set of MRs for testing any bio-entity recognition program. Then we develop a set of test cases that can be used to test LingPipe's bio-entity recognition functionality using these MRs. To evaluate the effectiveness of this testing process, we automatically generate a set of faulty versions of LingPipe. According to our analysis of the experimental results, we observe that our MRs can detect the majority of these faulty versions, which shows the utility of this testing technique for quality assurance of bioinformatics software. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

# 13 - A critical review of "a practical guide to select quality indicators for assessing pareto-based search algorithms in search-based software engineering": Essay on quality indicator selection for SBSE

This paper presents a critical review of the work published at ICSE'2016 on a practical guide of quality indicator selection for assessing multiobjective solution sets in search-based software engineering (SBSE). This review has two goals. First, we aim at explaining why we disagree with the work at ICSE'2016 and why the reasons behind this disagreement are important to the SBSE community. Second, we aim at providing a more clarified guide of quality indicator selection, serving as a new direction on this particular topic for the SBSE community. In particular, we argue that it does matter which quality indicator to select, whatever in the same quality category or across different categories. This claim is based upon the fundamental goal of multiobjective optimisation-supplying the decision-maker a set of solutions which are the most consistent with their preferences. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

# 14 - Assessing the quality of industrial avionics software: an extensive empirical evaluation

## Wu J., Ali S., Yue T., Tian J., Liu C.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84976479544&doi=10.1007%2fs10664-016-9440-x&partnerID=40&md5=e1761f9abd032dfbd75cb4f93279a681

A real-time operating system for avionics (RTOS4A) provides an operating environment for avionics application software. Since an RTOS4A has safety-critical applications, demonstrating a satisfactory level of its quality to its stakeholders is very important. By assessing the variation in quality across consecutive releases of an industrial RTOS4A based on test data collected over 17 months, we aim to provide a set of guidelines to 1) improve the test effectiveness and thus the quality of subsequent RTOS4A releases and 2) similarly assess the quality of other systems from test data. We carefully defined a set of research questions, for which we defined a number of variables (based on available test data), including release and measures of test effort, test effectiveness, complexity, test efficiency, test strength, and failure density. With these variables, to assess the quality in terms of number of failures found in tests, we applied a combination of analyses, including trend analysis using two-dimensional graphs, correlation analysis using Spearman’s test, and difference analysis using the Wilcoxon rank test. Key results include the following: 1) The number of failures and failure density decreased in the latest releases and the test coverage was either high or did not decrease with each release; 2) increased test effort was spent on modules of greater complexity and the number of failures was not high in these modules; and 3) the test coverage for modules without failures was not lower than the test coverage for modules with failures uncovered in all the releases. The overall assessment, based on the evidences, suggests that the quality of the latest RTOS4A release has improved. We conclude that the quality of the RTOS4A studied was improved in the latest release. In addition, our industrial partner found our guidelines useful and we believe that these guidelines can be used to assess the quality of other applications in the future. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

# 15 - Impact of customization over software quality in ERP projects: an empirical study

## Parthasarathy S., Sharma S.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84964057687&doi=10.1007%2fs11219-016-9314-x&partnerID=40&md5=bbbd3a489ccce59d7785bbfd59804021

Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems are recognized as management information systems that streamline business processes of an enterprise. Delivering ERP software to meet functional needs of an organization with acceptable level of quality is a challenge due to the very nature of development and deployment of this packaged software. Drawing on ISO/IEC 9126’s characterization of software quality and Luo and Strong’s ERP customization framework, this paper analyzes the impact of the ERP system customization on software quality of ERP. A software quality framework for ERP customization has been developed, and three sets of hypotheses have been formulated. A detailed survey was conducted for data collection. The statistical data analysis reveals that module customization does not impact ERP quality, while database and source code customizations have significant influence over ERP quality. Our findings have implications for the implementation of customized ERP in organizations. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

# 16 - Productivity paradoxes revisited: Assessing the relationship between quality maturity levels and labor productivity in brazilian software companies

## C. Duarte C.H.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84989910841&doi=10.1007%2fs10664-016-9453-5&partnerID=40&md5=c4582eabccfbbf9c77fc764b7dd8fa00

The adoption of quality assurance methods based on software process improvement models has been regarded as an important source of variability in software productivity. Some companies perceive that their implementation has prohibitive costs, whereas some authors identify in their use a way to comply with software development patterns and standards, produce economic value and lead to corporate performance improvement. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between quality maturity levels and labor productivity, using a data set containing 687 Brazilian software firms. We study here the relationship between labor productivity, as measured through the annual gross revenue per worker ratio, and quality levels, which were appraised from 2006 to 2012 according to two distinct software process improvement models: MPS.BR and CMMI. We perform independent statistical tests using appraisals carried out according to each of these models, consequently obtaining a data set with as many observations as possible, in order to seek strong support for our research. We first show that MPS.BR and CMMI appraised quality maturity levels are correlated, but we find no statistical evidence that they are related to higher labor productivity or productivity growth. On the contrary, we present evidence suggesting that average labor productivity is higher in software companies without appraised quality levels. Moreover, our analyses suggest that companies with appraised quality maturity levels are more or less productive depending on factors such as their business nature, main origin of capital and maintained quality level. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

# 17 - A systematic literature review on the applications of Bayesian networks to predict software quality

## Tosun A., Bener A.B., Akbarinasaji S.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84948125967&doi=10.1007%2fs11219-015-9297-z&partnerID=40&md5=afee43bb29c0fd48b13f52c1eb165e36

Bayesian networks (BN) have been used for decision making in software engineering for many years. In other fields such as bioinformatics, BNs are rigorously evaluated in terms of the techniques that are used to build the network structure and to learn the parameters. We extend our prior mapping study to investigate the extent to which contextual and methodological details regarding BN construction are reported in the studies. We conduct a systematic literature review on the applications of BNs to predict software quality. We focus on more detailed questions regarding (1) dataset characteristics, (2) techniques used for parameter learning, (3) techniques used for structure learning, (4) use of tools, and (5) model validation techniques. Results on ten primary studies show that BNs are mostly built based on expert knowledge, i.e. structure and prior distributions are defined by experts, whereas authors benefit from BN tools and quantitative data to validate their models. In most of the papers, authors do not clearly explain their justification for choosing a specific technique, and they do not compare their proposed BNs with other machine learning approaches. There is also a lack of consensus on the performance measures to validate the proposed BNs. Compared to other domains, the use of BNs is still very limited and current publications do not report enough details to replicate the studies. We propose a framework that provides a set of guidelines for reporting the essential contextual and methodological details of BNs. We believe such a framework would be useful to replicate and extend the work on BNs. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

# 18 - On the use of many quality attributes for software refactoring: a many-objective search-based software engineering approach

## Mkaouer M.W., Kessentini M., Bechikh S., Ó Cinnéide M., Deb K.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84951756385&doi=10.1007%2fs10664-015-9414-4&partnerID=40&md5=9b6ecf0a25cc8eb003e321aff9f5b63c

Search-based software engineering (SBSE) solutions are still not scalable enough to handle high-dimensional objectives space. The majority of existing work treats software engineering problems from a single or bi-objective point of view, where the main goal is to maximize or minimize one or two objectives. However, most software engineering problems are naturally complex in which many conflicting objectives need to be optimized. Software refactoring is one of these problems involving finding a compromise between several quality attributes to improve the quality of the system while preserving the behavior. To this end, we propose a novel representation of the refactoring problem as a many-objective one where every quality attribute to improve is considered as an independent objective to be optimized. In our approach based on the recent NSGA-III algorithm, the refactoring solutions are evaluated using a set of 8 distinct objectives. We evaluated this approach on one industrial project and seven open source systems. We compared our findings to: several other many-objective techniques (IBEA, MOEA/D, GrEA, and DBEA-Eps), an existing multi-objective approach a mono-objective technique and an existing refactoring technique not based on heuristic search. Statistical analysis of our experiments over 31 runs shows the efficiency of our approach. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

# 19 - An empirical study of the impact of modern code review practices on software quality

## McIntosh S., Kamei Y., Adams B., Hassan A.E.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84928384936&doi=10.1007%2fs10664-015-9381-9&partnerID=40&md5=4ccadde0c9552d2747cfa6bdf80ff3ca

Software code review, i.e., the practice of having other team members critique changes to a software system, is a well-established best practice in both open source and proprietary software domains. Prior work has shown that formal code inspections tend to improve the quality of delivered software. However, the formal code inspection process mandates strict review criteria (e.g., in-person meetings and reviewer checklists) to ensure a base level of review quality, while the modern, lightweight code reviewing process does not. Although recent work explores the modern code review process, little is known about the relationship between modern code review practices and long-term software quality. Hence, in this paper, we study the relationship between post-release defects (a popular proxy for long-term software quality) and: (1) code review coverage, i.e., the proportion of changes that have been code reviewed, (2) code review participation, i.e., the degree of reviewer involvement in the code review process, and (3) code reviewer expertise, i.e., the level of domain-specific expertise of the code reviewers. Through a case study of the Qt, VTK, and ITK projects, we find that code review coverage, participation, and expertise share a significant link with software quality. Hence, our results empirically confirm the intuition that poorly-reviewed code has a negative impact on software quality in large systems using modern reviewing tools. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.
