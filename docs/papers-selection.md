Industrial software systems are being increasingly developed by large and distributed teams. Tools like collaborative development environments (CDE) are used to facilitate interaction between members of such teams, with the expectation that social factors around the interaction would facilitate team functioning. In this paper, we first identify typically social characteristics of interaction in a software development team: reachability, connection, association, and clustering. We then examine how these factors relate to the quality of software produced by a team, in terms of the number of defects, through an empirical study of 70+ teams, involving 900+ developers in total, spread across 30+ locations and 19 time-zones, working on 40,000+ units of work in the multi-version development of a major industrial product, spreading across more than five years. After controlling for known factors affecting large scale distributed development such as dependency, system age, developer expertise and experience, geographic dispersion, socio-technical congruence, and the number of files changed, we find statistically significant effects of connection and clustering on software quality. Higher levels of intra-team connection are found to relate to higher defect count, whereas more clustering relates to fewer defects. We examine the implications of these results for individual developers, project managers, and organizations. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

## 11 - Software quality through the eyes of the end-user and static analysis tools: A study on Android OSS applications

### Srisopha K., Alfayez R.

### https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85051522416&doi=10.1145%2f3194095.3194096&partnerID=40&md5=7a9dc5d4116e134e2a85128cb3328d90

Source code analysis tools have been the vehicle for measuring and assessing the quality of a software product for decades. However, recently many studies have shown that post-deployment end-user reviews provide a wealth of insight into the quality of a software product and how it should evolve and be maintained. For example, end-user reviews help to identify missing features or inform developers about incorrect or unexpected software behavior. We believe that analyzing end-user reviews and utilizing analysis tools are a crucial step towards understanding the complete picture of the quality of a software product, as well as towards reasoning about the evolution history of it. In this paper, we investigate whether both methods correlate with one another. In other words, we explore if there exists a relationship between user satisfaction and the application's internal quality characteristics. To conduct our research, we analyze a total of 46 actual releases of three Android open source software (OSS) applications on the Google Play Store. For each release, we employ multiple static analysis tools to assess several aspects of the application's software quality. We retrieve and manually analyze the complete reviews after each release of each application from its store page, totaling 1004 reviews. Our initial results suggest that having high or low code quality does not necessary ensure user overall satisfaction. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

## 34 - Introduction of static quality analysis in small- and medium-sized software enterprises: experiences from technology transfer

### Gleirscher M., Golubitskiy D., Irlbeck M., Wagner S.

### https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84927804487&doi=10.1007%2fs11219-013-9217-z&partnerID=40&md5=96b5166ac6f386a4db36845b014b836d

Today, small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the software industry face major challenges. Their resource constraints require high efficiency in development. Furthermore, quality assurance (QA) measures need to be taken to mitigate the risk of additional, expensive effort for bug fixes or compensations. Automated static analysis (ASA) can reduce this risk because it promises low application effort. SMEs seem to take little advantage of this opportunity. Instead, they still mainly rely on the dynamic analysis approach of software testing. In this article, we report on our experiences from a technology transfer project. Our aim was to evaluate the results static analysis can provide for SMEs as well as the problems that occur when introducing and using static analysis in SMEs. We analysed five software projects from five collaborating SMEs using three different ASA techniques: code clone detection, bug pattern detection and architecture conformance analysis. Following the analysis, we applied a quality model to aggregate and evaluate the results. Our study shows that the effort required to introduce ASA techniques in SMEs is small (mostly below one person-hour each). Furthermore, we encountered only few technical problems. By means of the analyses, we could detect multiple defects in production code. The participating companies perceived the analysis results to be a helpful addition to their current QA and will include the analyses in their QA process. With the help of the Quamoco quality model, we could efficiently aggregate and rate static analysis results. However, we also encountered a partial mismatch with the opinions of the SMEs. We conclude that ASA and quality models can be a valuable and affordable addition to the QA process of SMEs. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013.

## 45 - A systematic review of quality attributes and measures for software product lines

### Montagud S., Abrahão S., Insfran E.

### https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84865626740&doi=10.1007%2fs11219-011-9146-7&partnerID=40&md5=33b25cd0a25fc09685e06cbc9c988f14

It is widely accepted that software measures provide an appropriate mechanism for understanding, monitoring, controlling, and predicting the quality of software development projects. In software product lines (SPL), quality is even more important than in a single software product since, owing to systematic reuse, a fault or an inadequate design decision could be propagated to several products in the family. Over the last few years, a great number of quality attributes and measures for assessing the quality of SPL have been reported in literature. However, no studies summarizing the current knowledge about them exist. This paper presents a systematic literature review with the objective of identifying and interpreting all the available studies from 1996 to 2010 that present quality attributes and/or measures for SPL. These attributes and measures have been classified using a set of criteria that includes the life cycle phase in which the measures are applied; the corresponding quality characteristics; their support for specific SPL characteristics (e. g., variability, compositionality); the procedure used to validate the measures, etc. We found 165 measures related to 97 different quality attributes. The results of the review indicated that 92% of the measures evaluate attributes that are related to maintainability. In addition, 67% of the measures are used during the design phase of Domain Engineering, and 56% are applied to evaluate the product line architecture. However, only 25% of them have been empirically validated. In conclusion, the results provide a global vision of the state of the research within this area in order to help researchers in detecting weaknesses, directing research efforts, and identifying new research lines. In particular, there is a need for new measures with which to evaluate both the quality of the artifacts produced during the entire SPL life cycle and other quality characteristics. There is also a need for more validation (both theoretical and empirical) of existing measures. In addition, our results may be useful as a reference guide for practitioners to assist them in the selection or the adaptation of existing measures for evaluating their software product lines. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

## 46 - Standardized code quality benchmarking for improving software maintainability

### Baggen R., Correia J.P., Schill K., Visser J.

### https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84860465895&doi=10.1007%2fs11219-011-9144-9&partnerID=40&md5=042a7624f2cb95e1a97643ef8e0f9071

We provide an overview of the approach developed by the Software Improvement Group for code analysis and quality consulting focused on software maintainability. The approach uses a standardized measurement model based on the ISO/IEC 9126 definition of maintainability and source code metrics. Procedural standardization in evaluation projects further enhances the comparability of results. Individual assessments are stored in a repository that allows any system at hand to be compared to the industrywide state of the art in code quality and maintainability. When a minimum level of software maintainability is reached, the certification body of TÜV Informationstechnik GmbH issues a Trusted Product Maintainability certificate for the software product. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.

## 61 - Software quality models: Purposes, usage scenarios and requirements

### Deissenboeck F., Juergens E., Lochmann K., Wagner S.

### https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-78049485828&doi=10.1109%2fWOSQ.2009.5071551&partnerID=40&md5=8fcbe52cf221d20710deaf02231c9c19

Software quality models are a well-accepted means to support quality management of software systems. Over the last 30 years, a multitude of quality models have been proposed and applied with varying degrees of success. Despite successes and standardisation efforts, quality models are still being criticised, as their application in practice exhibits various problems. To some extent, this criticism is caused by an unclear definition of what quality models are and which purposes they serve. Beyond this, there is a lack of explicitly stated requirements for quality models with respect to their intended mode of application. To remedy this, this paper describes purposes and usage scenarios of quality models and, based on the literature and experiences from the authors, collects critique of existing models. From this, general requirements for quality models are derived. The requirements can be used to support the evaluation of existing quality models for a given context or to guide further quality model development. © 2009 IEEE.

## 64 - Inspection effectiveness for different quality attributes of software requirement specifications: An industrial case study

### Salger F., Engels G., Hofmann A.

### https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77955167159&doi=10.1109%2fWOSQ.2009.5071552&partnerID=40&md5=6f5d87e6b9a0e8abe8256ba0756f9df0

Early inspections of software requirements specifications (SRS) are known to be an effective and cost-efficient quality assurance technique. However, inspections are often applied with the underlying assumption that they work equally well to assess all kinds of quality attributes of SRS. Little work has yet been done to validate this assumption. At Capgemini sd&m, we set up an inspection technique to assess SRS, the so called "specification quality gate" (QG-Spec). The QG-Spec has been applied to a series of large scale commercial projects. In this paper we present our lessons learned and discuss, which quality attributes are effectively assessed by means of the QG-Spec - and which are not. We argue that our results can be generalized to other existing inspection techniques. We came to the conclusion that inspections have to be carefully balanced with techniques for constructive quality assurance in order to economically arrive at high quality SRS. © 2009 IEEE.

## 72 - Should we try to measure software quality attributes directly?

### Moses J.

### https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-64249172602&doi=10.1007%2fs11219-008-9071-6&partnerID=40&md5=0648b6d6e222796c2e98f7d73d843380

Most external software quality attributes are conceptually subjective. For example, maintainability is an external software quality attribute, and it is subjective because interpersonally agreed definitions for the attribute include the phrase 'the ease with which maintenance tasks can be performed'. Subjectivity clearly makes measurement of the attributes and validation of prediction systems for the attributes problematic. In fact, in spite of the definitions, few statistically valid attempts at determining the predictive capability of prediction systems for external quality attributes have been published. When validations have been attempted, one approach used is to ask experts to indicate if the values provided by the prediction system informally agree with the experts' intuition. These attempts are undertaken without determining, independently of the prediction system, whether the experts are capable of direct consistent measurement of the attribute. Hence, a statistically valid and unbiased estimate of the predictive capability of the prediction system cannot be obtained (because the experts' measurement process is not independent of the prediction system's values). In this paper, it is argued that the problem of subjective measurement of quality attributes should not be ignored if quality is to be introduced into software in a controlled way. Further, it is argued that direct measurement of quality attributes should be encouraged and that in fact such measurement can be quantified to establish consistency using an existing approach. However, the approach needs to be made more accessible to promote its use. In so doing, it would be possible to decide whether consistent independent estimates of the true values of software quality attributes can be assigned and prediction systems for quality attributes developed. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

## 74 - Continuous software quality supervision using source inventory and columbus

### Bakota T., Beszédes A., Ferenc R., Gyimóthy T.

### https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-57349138856&doi=10.1145%2f1370175.1370193&partnerID=40&md5=da38b72dde1093c2ee7dba33829c5806

Several tools and methods for source code quality assurance based on static analysis finally reached a state when they are applicable in practice and recognized by the industry. However, most of these tools are used in an isolated manner and very rarely as organic parts of the quality assurance process. Furthermore, little or no help is provided in interpreting the outputs of these tools. This paper presents Source Inventory, a system for source code-based software quality assessment and monitoring, which is able to collect, store and present measurement data including metrics, coding problems and other kinds of data like bug numbers and test coverage information. It helps software developers, architects and managers to take control over their software's quality by performing continuous code scans, fault detection, coding style verification, architecture violation detection, and automatic report generation considering metric baselines.

## 82 - The EMISQ method - Expert based evaluation of internal software quality

### Plösch R., Gruber H., Hentschel A., Körner Ch., Pomberger G., Schiffer S., Saft M., Storck S.

### https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-47749132628&doi=10.1109%2fSEW.2007.71&partnerID=40&md5=cd7975c8b3e6f9fec2a175545c539b15

Internal software quality, e.g. the quality of code, has great impact on the overall quality of software. Besides well known manual inspection and review techniques more recent approaches utilize tool-based static code for the evaluation of internal software quality. Despite the high potential of static code analyzers the application of tools alone cannot replace well founded expert opinion. Knowledge, experience and fair judgement is indispensable for a valid, reliable quality assessment, which is accepted by software developers and managers. The EMISQ method (Evaluation Method for Internal Software Quality), guides the assessment process for all stakeholders of an evaluation project. The method is supported by a tool that assists evaluators with their analysis and rating tasks and provides support for generating a code quality report. The application of the method in a pilot project has shown its applicability.

## 83 - In search for a widely applicable and accepted software quality model for software quality engineering

### Côté M.-A., Suryn W., Georgiadou E.

### https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-36549049028&doi=10.1007%2fs11219-007-9029-0&partnerID=40&md5=59c39869ee11beea4f39ae055a8804c0

Software Quality Engineering is an emerging discipline that is concerned with improving the approach to software quality. It is important that this discipline be firmly rooted in a quality model satisfying its needs. In order to define the needs of this discipline, the meaning of quality is broadly defined by reviewing the literature on the subject. Software Quality Engineering needs a quality model that is usable throughout the software lifecycle and that it embraces all the perspectives of quality. The goal of this paper is to propose the characteristics of a quality model suitable for such a purpose, through the comparative evaluation of existing quality models and their respective support for Software Quality Engineering. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

## 85 - Achieving quality in open-source software

### Aberdour M.

The open source software community has published a substantial body of research on OSS quality. Focusing on this peer-reviewed body of work lets us draw conclusions from empirical data rather than rely on the large volume of evangelical opinion that has historically dominated this field. This body of published research has become much more critical and objective in its efforts to understand OSS development, and a consensus has emerged on the key components of high-quality OSS delivery. This article reviews this body of research and draws out lessons learned, investigating how the approaches used to deliver high-quality OSS differ from, and can be incorporated into, closed-source software development. © 2007 IEEE.

## 92 - Software quality development and assurance in RUP, MSF and XP -A comparative study

### Zuser W., Heil S., Grechenig T.

### https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84885903144&doi=10.1145%2f1083292.1083300&partnerID=40&md5=c47fec6c93dd2cc890ba61b5ce2ab7c1

The support of software quality in a software development process may be regarded under two aspects: first, by providing techniques, which support the development of high quality software and second, by providing techniques, which assure the required quality attributes in existing artifacts. Both approaches have to be combined to achieve effective and successful software engineering. In this study, we compare three of the most industrially relevant software development process models (Rational Unified Process (RUP), Microsoft Solution Framework (MSF) and Extreme Programming (XP)) regarding their software quality support in terms of software quality development and software quality assurance. Based on the results we propose a de-facto standard for quality support in software development process models. © 2005 ACM.

## 94 - Improving scientific software component quality through assertions

### Dahlgren T.L., Devanbu P.T.

### https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77954433188&doi=10.1145%2f1145319.1145341&partnerID=40&md5=3e2d8e96ab9ab9d7e44210eba3b18e87

We are proposing research on self-adaptive interface assertion enforcement for the purposes of improving scientific software component quality. Demonstrating software correctness through assertions is a well-known technique for quality improvement. However, the performance penalty is often considered too high for deployment. In order to determine if partial enforcement based on adaptive sampling is a viable solution in performance critical environments, we are pursuing research on mechanisms combining static and dynamic analyses to efficiently maximize assertion checking within performance constraints.

## 99 - The evolution path for industrial software quality evaluation methods applying ISO/IEC 9126:2001 quality model: Example of MITRE's SQAE method

### Côté M.-A., Suryn W., Laporte C.Y., Martin R.A.

This paper examines how the industrial applicability of both ISO/IEC 9126:2001 and MITRE Corporation's Software Quality Assessment Exercise (SQAE) can be bolstered by migrating SQAE's quality model to ISO/IEC 9126:2001. The migration of the quality model is accomplished through the definition of an abstraction layer. The consolidated quality model is examined and further improvements to enrich the assessment of quality are enumerated. © 2005 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc.

A user survey was carried out to evaluate empirically ISO/IEC 9126's dimensionality, or the classification of characteristics, and internal- consistency reliability. In the survey, users evaluated their satisfaction concerning the quality of a packaged software product according to the criteria of ISO/IEC 9126's subcharacteristics. Overall, results reveal ambiguities in the way that ISO/IEC 9126 is structured in terms of characteristics and subcharacteristics.

## 108 - Construction of a systemic quality model for evaluating a software product

### Ortega M., Pérez M., Rojas T.

### https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-3543054780&doi=10.1023%2fA%3a1025166710988&partnerID=40&md5=f6915840807fb5204c5c331644d47524

Quality is currently considered one of the main assets with which a firm can enhance its competitive global position. This is one reason why quality has become essential for ensuring that a company's products and processes meet customers' needs. A recent innovation in the systems area is the development of a set of mechanisms and models for evaluating quality. This article describes the design of a Quality Model with a systemic approach to software products that assesses a product's efficiency and effectiveness. Different quality models were studied: McCall, Boehm, FURPS, ISO 9126, Dromey, ISO 15504 in an attempt to identify the aspects present in these models that are deemed important in a Systemic Quality model. We designed a model prototype that reflects the essential attributes of quality. This model was evaluated using a method so it can be validated and also enhanced. The evaluation method consisted of: designing a survey, formulating, validating and applying the measurement instruments; defining an algorithm to obtain the quality estimate and analyzing the results. The model prototype enabled the strengths and weaknesses of the software products studied to be identified. When evaluating a software product using the model prototype, it was possible to ascertain its compliance with the standards and use the results to improve it. Since the evaluation was systemic, processes that affect certain characteristics of the product could be identified. Companies can benefit from the model proposed because it serves as a benchmark that allows their products to evolve and be competitive.

## 112 - Multi-Criteria Methodology Contribution to the Software Quality Evaluation

### Blin M.-J., Tsoukiàs A.

### https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0011893888&doi=10.1023%2fA%3a1016626919680&partnerID=40&md5=a137d99a58bbb4836370b1d4ff3554bc

Industrial evaluations of COTS software largely used the quality models provided by the international standards. But the context and objectives of COTS evaluations are fundamentally different than those primarily defined by the standards. Several key issues are often forgotten: (1) the existence of several evaluators and several quality models sharing common factors, criteria and measures, (2) the purpose of the evaluation model, (3) measures of different types, and (4) the recursive nature of the model since each node is an evaluation model itself. We had the occasion to study the results of real standard-based COTS evaluations. Faced with the difficulties to exploit them, we experimented the use of multi-criteria methodology. This work allows us to understand some of the problems generated by the application of the standards to COTS evaluations, and to propose new principles for evaluating software quality that should be considered in an evolution of the standards. This paper reports our experiment.

## 116 - Software quality analysis & measurement service activity in the company

### Tanaka Takeshi, Aizawa Minoru, Ogasawara Hideto, Yamada Atsushi

### https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0031597187&doi=10.1109%2fICSE.1998.671598&partnerID=40&md5=377b5ac3a4b038bfd392e01d4e7c6600

It is very important to improve software quality using program analysis & measurement tools and SQA (Software Quality Assurance) method at the appropriate points during the process of development. But in many development departments, there is often not enough time to evaluate and use the tools and SQA method or to accumulate the know-how for effective use. This paper describes the support activity of a software quality analysis & measurement service which is performed by our team of laboratory within the company as a third-party independent staff group. We call this activity HQC (High Quality software creation support virtual Center). The purpose of this activity is as follows. First we improve the software quality engineering process in the development department, for example, we help them to increase efficiency of review or testing. To accomplish this, we use program static analysis tools to detect fault-prone software components. Next we assist in starting their own self-improvement process. In addition, we provide service activity to many development departments concurrently. We have been making progress with these activities, and some development departments have begun to establish improvement process themselves.

### https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0642363924&doi=10.1023%2fA%3a1018591430752&partnerID=40&md5=9181348bb75865be23649ef29338594f

A considerable number of software suppliers report improvements in product and service quality, development costs and time to market achieved with the help of the ISO 9000 standards. Nevertheless, the ISO 9000 family has received unfavourable criticism in journals, textbooks and at software quality conferences. The paper summarizes, discusses and reviews eleven of the most popular arguments against the ISO 9000 standards. The review of the criticism is based on findings of two empirical surveys among European software suppliers that have implemented an ISO 9000 quality system. The paper concludes with suggestions and guidelines for advances in software quality management concepts, such as the ISO 9000 family, CMM, BOOTSTRAP and the emerging SPICE standard.

## 120 - Specifying software quality with the extended ISO model

### Van Zeist R.H.J.

### https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-27144550799&doi=10.1007%2fBF00209185&partnerID=40&md5=64394714677ede47867fcd1a5625efff

Specifying the quality of software products is a valuable addition to functional specification, clarifying product properties such as learnability and availability. Specifying such properties is considered difficult due to the different parties involved and the implicit nature of the requirements. The QUINT project gathered experience with product specification by means of the Extended ISO model: an extension to the ISO 9126 model of software quality. By defining indicators and specifying how they should be measured, quality specifications can make requirements explicit. Recommendations and pitfalls for composing a specification are grouped by the context in which quality specifications can be used. © 1996 Chapman & Hall.

This paper has developed from the SoFEA project at The open University which is studying the non-technical aspects of quality in software. This involves seeing the technical elements of software development as very much part of a wider context. The culture of an organization as a whole, particularly its management strategies, are regarded as driving and shaping the technology. A particular challenge for management we have observed is how to harmonize a skilled individualist (affectionately dubbed a 'maverick') and a quality management system. We explore the characteristics of an individualist programmer and discuss the options for managing such a person. Some of the experiences of a scientific organization are reported. © 1996 Chapman & Hall.

## 127 - Factors affecting the quality of software project management:an empirical study based on the Capability Maturity Model

### Mcguire E.G.

### https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0007176737&doi=10.1007%2fBF00209188&partnerID=40&md5=8a9f2fa4e39735762608ce94c38112e4

Rigorous project management can help raise a software product development process from an initial, immature stage that is unstable and unrepeatable to an optimized maturity level characterized by continuous improvement and innovation. Goals and actions related to a repeatable project management process have been outlined in the Capability Maturity Model (CMM) developed by the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. The CMM provides good guidelines for initiating software process improvement particularly in the project management area; however, the successful implementation of the CMM guidelines is often not accomplished without significant organizational change involving increased emphasis on change management, teams and employee empowerment. This paper is empirically based on observations, surveys, and interviews of project team managers and project team members in a large, multinational organization. The focus of the paper is on the development of a project management process that emphasizes project planning, change management, quality management, team work, and process control. Findings presented in this paper are correlated with the CMM guidelines as well as organizational factors that were found to enable or impede the successful deployment of various aspects of a project management improvement plan. The role of education and training in process and quality techniques as well as project management tools that support group work is also examined. This paper provides some insight into the issues faced by organizations based on traditional hierarchy or matrix management as they attempt to move into a more process-driven, quality-oriented development environment. As organizations move towards global markets they need increased emphasis on quality, value, teams, standards and global project management strategies based on structured guidelines to handle process Sow within and between projects, departments, organizations, and national boundaries. © 1996 Chapman & Hall.

## 128 - Experiences of software quality management using metrics through the life-cycle

### Ogasawara Hideto, Yamada Atsushi, Kojo Michiko

### https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0029516009&partnerID=40&md5=68106def0b53f2f1a609753364cb4705

Many software quality metrics to objectively grasp software products and process have been proposed in the past decades. In actual projects, quality metrics has been widely applied to manage software quality. However, there are still several problems with providing effective feedback to intermediate software products and the software development process. We have proposed a software quality management using quality metrics which are easily and automatically measured. The purpose of this proposal is to establish a method for building in software quality by regularly measuring and reviewing. This paper outlines a model for building in software quality using quality metrics, and describes examples of its application to actual projects and its results. As the results, it was found that quality metrics can be used to detect and remove problems with process and products in each phase. Regular technical reviews using quality metrics and information on the change of the regularly measured results was also found to have a positive influence on the structure and module size of programs. Further, in the test phase, it was found that with the proposed model, the progress of corrective action could be quickly and accurately grasped.

## 140 - Modelling software quality in the commercial environment

### Gillies A.

### https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0001332319&doi=10.1007%2fBF01720924&partnerID=40&md5=a0b468b060b629ea3ced5fefac2c2848

Achieving quality is a perennial problem in software development. It is commercially significant because of the large sums of money spent correcting problems within information systems. The literature shows how various theoretical treatments have developed since the late 1970s. However, many of these models are of academic interest only, because they are not perceived by IT professionals to meet their needs. This article describes a study which examined the nature of quality in six different commercial environments. The aim of the study was to provide models of quality appropriate to individual commercial environments and to examine similarities between them. The results, expressed in terms of quality criteria and the relationships between them, highlight the limitations of many theoretical treatments, in particular, the highly technical view of software quality enshrined in early models, and the need for criteria contributing to 'business correctness'. The results from the study are used to highlight some of the important issues in software quality within commercial environments and some of the reasons why quality is often poor. © 1992 Chapman & Hall.

## 146 - Quantitative evaluation of software quality

### Boehm B.W., Brown J.R., Lipow M.

### https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85042377749&partnerID=40&md5=86df793c94725cf352a0b8b3d8227c3c

The study reported in this paper establishes a conceptual framework and some key initial results in the analysis of the characteristics of software quality. Its main results and conclusions are: • Explicit attention to characteristics of software quality can lead to significant savings in software life-cycle costs. • The current software state-of-the-art imposes specific limitations on our ability to automatically and quantitatively evaluate the quality of software. • A definitive hierarchy of well-defined, well-differentiated characteristics of software quality is developed. Its higher-level structure reflects the actual uses to which software quality evaluation would be put; its lower-level characteristics are closely correlated with actual software metric evaluations which can be performed. • A large number of software quality-evaluation metrics have been defined, classified, and evaluated with respect to their potential benefits, quantifiability, and ease of automation. • Particular software life-cycle activities have been identified which have significant leverage on software quality. Most importantly, we believe that the study reported in this paper provides for the first time a clear, well-defined framework for assessing the often slippery issues associated with software quality, via the consistent and mutually supportive sets of definitions, distinctions, guidelines, and experiences cited. This framework is certainly not complete, but it has been brought to a point sufficient to serve as a viable basis for future refinements and extensions. © 1976 IEEE Computer Society.

## 3 - The sustainability of quality in free and open source software

### Alami A.

### https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85094174322&doi=10.1145%2f3377812.3381402&partnerID=40&md5=afb03b21ee1d83333f142cfdf9d75b14

We learned from the history of software that great software are theones who manage to sustain their quality. Free and open sourcesoftware (FOSS) has become a serious software supply channel.However, trust on FOSS products is still an issue. Quality is a traitthat enhances trust. In my study, I investigate the following question: how do FOSS communities sustain their software quality? Iargue that human and social factors contribute to the sustainabilityof quality in FOSS communities. Amongst these factors are: themotivation of participants, robust governance style for the software change process, and the exercise of good practices in the pullrequests evaluation process. © 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

## 13 - A critical review of "a practical guide to select quality indicators for assessing pareto-based search algorithms in search-based software engineering": Essay on quality indicator selection for SBSE

### Li M., Chen T., Yao X.

### https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85049805170&doi=10.1145%2f3183399.3183405&partnerID=40&md5=cf1c999ddeb3da395195f2ba42440d27

This paper presents a critical review of the work published at ICSE'2016 on a practical guide of quality indicator selection for assessing multiobjective solution sets in search-based software engineering (SBSE). This review has two goals. First, we aim at explaining why we disagree with the work at ICSE'2016 and why the reasons behind this disagreement are important to the SBSE community. Second, we aim at providing a more clarified guide of quality indicator selection, serving as a new direction on this particular topic for the SBSE community. In particular, we argue that it does matter which quality indicator to select, whatever in the same quality category or across different categories. This claim is based upon the fundamental goal of multiobjective optimisation-supplying the decision-maker a set of solutions which are the most consistent with their preferences. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

## 15 - Impact of customization over software quality in ERP projects: an empirical study

### Parthasarathy S., Sharma S.

### https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84964057687&doi=10.1007%2fs11219-016-9314-x&partnerID=40&md5=bbbd3a489ccce59d7785bbfd59804021

Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems are recognized as management information systems that streamline business processes of an enterprise. Delivering ERP software to meet functional needs of an organization with acceptable level of quality is a challenge due to the very nature of development and deployment of this packaged software. Drawing on ISO/IEC 9126’s characterization of software quality and Luo and Strong’s ERP customization framework, this paper analyzes the impact of the ERP system customization on software quality of ERP. A software quality framework for ERP customization has been developed, and three sets of hypotheses have been formulated. A detailed survey was conducted for data collection. The statistical data analysis reveals that module customization does not impact ERP quality, while database and source code customizations have significant influence over ERP quality. Our findings have implications for the implementation of customized ERP in organizations. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

## 16 - Productivity paradoxes revisited: Assessing the relationship between quality maturity levels and labor productivity in brazilian software companies

### C. Duarte C.H.

### https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84989910841&doi=10.1007%2fs10664-016-9453-5&partnerID=40&md5=c4582eabccfbbf9c77fc764b7dd8fa00

The adoption of quality assurance methods based on software process improvement models has been regarded as an important source of variability in software productivity. Some companies perceive that their implementation has prohibitive costs, whereas some authors identify in their use a way to comply with software development patterns and standards, produce economic value and lead to corporate performance improvement. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between quality maturity levels and labor productivity, using a data set containing 687 Brazilian software firms. We study here the relationship between labor productivity, as measured through the annual gross revenue per worker ratio, and quality levels, which were appraised from 2006 to 2012 according to two distinct software process improvement models: MPS.BR and CMMI. We perform independent statistical tests using appraisals carried out according to each of these models, consequently obtaining a data set with as many observations as possible, in order to seek strong support for our research. We first show that MPS.BR and CMMI appraised quality maturity levels are correlated, but we find no statistical evidence that they are related to higher labor productivity or productivity growth. On the contrary, we present evidence suggesting that average labor productivity is higher in software companies without appraised quality levels. Moreover, our analyses suggest that companies with appraised quality maturity levels are more or less productive depending on factors such as their business nature, main origin of capital and maintained quality level. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

## 19 - An empirical study of the impact of modern code review practices on software quality

### McIntosh S., Kamei Y., Adams B., Hassan A.E.

### https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84928384936&doi=10.1007%2fs10664-015-9381-9&partnerID=40&md5=4ccadde0c9552d2747cfa6bdf80ff3ca

Software code review, i.e., the practice of having other team members critique changes to a software system, is a well-established best practice in both open source and proprietary software domains. Prior work has shown that formal code inspections tend to improve the quality of delivered software. However, the formal code inspection process mandates strict review criteria (e.g., in-person meetings and reviewer checklists) to ensure a base level of review quality, while the modern, lightweight code reviewing process does not. Although recent work explores the modern code review process, little is known about the relationship between modern code review practices and long-term software quality. Hence, in this paper, we study the relationship between post-release defects (a popular proxy for long-term software quality) and: (1) code review coverage, i.e., the proportion of changes that have been code reviewed, (2) code review participation, i.e., the degree of reviewer involvement in the code review process, and (3) code reviewer expertise, i.e., the level of domain-specific expertise of the code reviewers. Through a case study of the Qt, VTK, and ITK projects, we find that code review coverage, participation, and expertise share a significant link with software quality. Hence, our results empirically confirm the intuition that poorly-reviewed code has a negative impact on software quality in large systems using modern reviewing tools. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

## 21 - Improving and balancing software qualities

### Boehm B.

### https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85026633467&doi=10.1145%2f2889160.2891049&partnerID=40&md5=6d99ef500aabca2de5eabfb37df2b2d4

This Technical Briefing describes the nature of Software Qualities (SQs), ilities, or non-functional requirements (reliability, usability, affordability, etc.), and discusses the importance of understanding their nature and interrelationships, and of bringing them into balance in the practice of software engineering. The relevance and timeliness of this topic reflects the current and future trends toward more software-intensive systems, with greater complexity, autonomy, speed of change, and need for interoperability within systems of systems, given the frequent system shortfalls and overruns that occur when their SQ balance is not achieved. It discusses the weaknesses of current SQ standards and guidance, and summarizes research toward strengthening current SQ definitions and relationships. This includes a set of initial SQ ontology elements and relationships, examples of their application to some key SQs, an identification of further research and development needed to make the ontology fully useful and evolvable, and the nature of an international collaborative effort to help improve current practices via a Qualipedia for accessing the evolving body of knowledge for improving SQ engineering. © 2016 Author.

## 24 - A practical guide to select quality indicators for assessing pareto-based search algorithms in search-based software engineering

### Wang S., Ali S., Yue T., Li Y., Liaaen M.

### https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84971412816&doi=10.1145%2f2884781.2884880&partnerID=40&md5=fb106f940fea5f845deddb5ac287de81

Many software engineering problems are multi-objective in nature, which has been largely recognized by the Search-based Software Engineering (SBSE) community. In this regard, Paretobased search algorithms, e.g., Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II, have already shown good performance for solving multi-objective optimization problems. These algorithms produce Pareto fronts, where each Pareto front consists of a set of nondominated solutions. Eventually, a user selects one or more of the solutions from a Pareto front for their specific problems. A key challenge of applying Pareto-based search algorithms is to select appropriate quality indicators, e.g., hypervolume, to assess the quality of Pareto fronts. Based on the results of an extended literature review, we found that the current literature and practice in SBSE lacks a practical guide for selecting quality indicators despite a large number of published SBSE works. In this direction, the paper presents a practical guide for the SBSE community to select quality indicators for assessing Pareto-based search algorithms in different software engineering contexts. The practical guide is derived from the following complementary theoretical and empirical methods: 1) key theoretical foundations of quality indicators; 2) evidence from an extended literature review; and 3) evidence collected from an extensive experiment that was conducted to evaluate eight quality indicators from four different categories with six Pareto-based search algorithms using three real industrial problems from two diverse domains. © 2016 ACM.

How can organizational factors such as structure and culture have an impact on the working conditions of developers? This study is based on ten months of observation of an in-house software development project within a large telecommunications company. The observation was conducted during mandatory weekly status meetings, where technical and managerial issues were raised and discussed. Preliminary results show that many decisions made under the pressure of certain organizational factors negatively affected software quality. This paper describes cases depicting the complexity of organizational factors and reports on ten issues that have had a negative impact on quality, followed by suggested avenues for corrective action. © 2015 IEEE.

## 58 - Quality specification and metrication, results from a case-study in a mission-critical software domain

### Trienekens J.J.M., Kusters R.J., Brussel D.C.

### https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77956057048&doi=10.1007%2fs11219-010-9101-z&partnerID=40&md5=8676a4867b80d63fce5b0d10d732fb63

Software quality is of increasing importance in mission-critical embedded software systems. Due to the fast growing complexity and accompanying risks of failures of these systems, software quality needs to be addressed explicitly by software developers, preferably with a systematic method for an optimal implementation of software qualities, such as reliability, time-behavior and usability. At the Centre of Automation of Mission-critical Systems (CAMS) of the Dutch Royal Navy, a new approach has been defined for software developers to improve the way that they deal with software quality in the process of mission-critical systems engineering. The stepwise approach is based on both an international quality standard for software product quality, i.e. ISO9126, and on Multi-Criteria Decision Making techniques, i.e. analytical hierarchy process (AHP). The stepwise approach has been validated in a case study. In particular, the tailoring of the ISO9126 standard toward the specific CAMS development situation, and the applicability of AHP techniques, from the perspective of software developers, has been investigated. The case study is carried out in a representative software development project, i.e. the software for combat management systems (CMS) of warships. Results of the case study show that software developers can explicitly deal with quality on the basis of both the ISO9126 standard and the AHP techniques, respectively regarding the specification, prioritization and metrication of software product quality. © 2010 The Author(s).

## 66 - Does distributed development affect software quality? An empirical case study of windows vista

### Bird C., Nagappan N., Devanbu P., Gall H., Murphy B.

### https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77949887177&doi=10.1109%2fICSE.2009.5070550&partnerID=40&md5=b2268150b63c60366c76b7fa3a7dd644

It is widely believed that distributed software development is riskier and more challenging than collocated development. Prior literature on distributed development in software engineering and other fields discuss various challenges, including cultural barriers, expertise transfer dif-ficulties, and communication and coordination overhead. We evaluate this conventional belief by examining the overall development of Windows Vista and comparing the postrelease failures of components that were developed in a distributed fashion with those that were developed by collocated teams. We found a negligible difference in failures. This difference becomes even less significant when controlling for the number of developers working on a binary. We also examine component characteristics such as code churn, complexity, dependency information, and test code coverage and find very little difference between distributed and collocated components to investigate if less complex components are more distributed. Further, we examine the software process and phenomena that occurred during the Vista development cycle and present ways in which the development process utilized may be insensitive to geography by mitigating the difficulties introduced in prior work in this area. © 2009 IEEE.

## 102 - Requirements engineering and process modelling in software quality management - Towards a generic process metamodel

### Berki E., Georgiadou E., Holcombe M.

### https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-3142676780&doi=10.1023%2fB%3aSQJO.0000034711.87241.f0&partnerID=40&md5=57a51d22bc656cff90603f0d24ae4251

This paper examines the concept of Quality in Software Engineering, its different contexts and its different meanings to various people. It begins with a commentary on quality issues for systems development and various stakeholders' involvement. It revisits aspects and concepts of systems development methods and highlights the relevance of quality issues to the choice of a process model. A summarised review of some families of methods is presented, where their application domain, lifecycle coverage, strengths and weaknesses are considered. Under the new development era the requirements of software development change; the role of methods and stakeholders change, too. The paper refers to the latest developments in the area of software engineering and emphasises the shift from traditional conceptual modelling to requirements engineering and process metamodelling principles. We provide support for an emerging discipline in the form of a software process metamodel to cover new issues for software quality and process improvement. The widening of the horizons of software engineering both as a 'communication tool' and as a 'scientific discipline' (and not as a 'craft') is needed in order to support both communicative and scientific quality systems properties. In general, we can consider such a discipline as a thinking tool for understanding the generic process and as the origin of combining intuition and quality engineering to transform requirements to adequate human-centred information systems.

## 104 - Analogy-Based Practical Classification Rules for Software Quality Estimation

### Khoshgoftaar T.M., Seliya N.

### https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0141924286&doi=10.1023%2fA%3a1025316301168&partnerID=40&md5=c55c23db4d307f95d3a30705f91b2729

Software metrics-based quality estimation models can be effective tools for identifying which modules are likely to be fault-prone or not fault-prone. The use of such models prior to system deployment can considerably reduce the likelihood of faults discovered during operations, hence improving system reliability. A software quality classification model is calibrated using metrics from a past release or similar project, and is then applied to modules currently under development. Subsequently, a timely prediction of which modules are likely to have faults can be obtained. However, software quality classification models used in practice may not provide a useful balance between the two misclassification rates, especially when there are very few faulty modules in the system being modeled. This paper presents, in the context of case-based reasoning, two practical classification rules that allow appropriate emphasis on each type of misclassification as per the project requirements. The suggested techniques are especially useful for high-assurance systems where faulty modules are rare. The proposed generalized classification methods emphasize on the costs of misclassifications, and the unbalanced distribution of the faulty program modules. We illustrate the proposed techniques with a case study that consists of software measurements and fault data collected over multiple releases of a large-scale legacy telecommunication system. In addition to investigating the two classification methods, a brief relative comparison of the techniques is also presented. It is indicated that the level of classification accuracy and model-robustness observed for the case study would be beneficial in achieving high software reliability of its subsequent system releases. Similar observations are made from our empirical studies with other case studies.

## 113 - Quality through Managed Improvement and Measurement (QMIM): Towards a Phased Development and Implementation of a Quality Management System for a Software Company

### Balla K., Bemelmans T., Kusters R., Trienekens J.

### https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0010645865&doi=10.1023%2fA%3a1013301503616&partnerID=40&md5=cfe9889727ca12badee4d71ce1c02868

The paper describes results of a longitudinal study of developments in the area of software product and process quality improvement within a Hungarian software company, IQSOFT Ltd. This company has been active in this area since 1993, trying to build, introduce and maintain an efficiently working quality management system which, e.g., fulfils the ISO 9001 requirements, allows steady software process improvement and, at the same time, conforms to company's own needs. Over the last eight years five phases could be distinguished. Each phase is described shortly, following the same structure, namely: basic starting points, key problem areas, literature consulted, activities and design executed, reflections on what happened and why. The lessons resulting from the analysis of this case have been formulated in terms of guidelines. We feel that these are applicable to any low maturity software development organisation embarking on a product or process quality improvement endeavour. These guidelines are developed around a framework containing the basic issues of software production (project management, technical processes and products). The guidelines advocate a careful step-by-step development of definitions, quality characteristics, and metrics related to these objects while at the same time developing and introducing the associated process.

## 141 - On specifying software quality

### Dromey R.G., McGettrick A.D.

### https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0008302517&doi=10.1007%2fBF01720169&partnerID=40&md5=f297222c53ba1b94f0ae36ebdd761820

Quality is recognized as a pre-eminently important characteristic of software, yet an understanding of how to usefully define it, and how to achieve it remains illusive. A constructive definition of quality is investigated and an approach to the construction of software of quality is suggested. The definition focusses on how well the solution fits the problem, the inherent quality of the design independent of the problem, and the quality of the design process that creates the solution. A constructive specification of software quality then follows based on the use of programming language syntax, design principles and strategies, post-construction program quality analysis systems, and computer-assisted program construction tools. Only by addressing the problem on much broader methodological, technical, and managerial fronts will it be possible to make significant gains in software quality. © 1992 Chapman & Hall.

## 20 - Software quality improvement: a model based on managing factors impacting software quality

### Janicijevic I., Krsmanovic M., Zivkovic N., Lazarevic S.

### https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84908118810&doi=10.1007%2fs11219-014-9257-z&partnerID=40&md5=49441ef38876a3665b52cb6086473831

Software quality is recognized as being very significant for achieving competitiveness in the software industry, so improvements in this area are gaining increasing importance. Software quality improvements can only be achieved by managing all of the factors that influence it. However, in a real business system, there are a great number of factors impacting software quality, while the processes are stochastic and resources are limited, so economic data should also be taken into consideration. This paper uses a Markov chain and proposes a systematic framework for modelling the stochastic processes of a quality management system and selection of the optimum set of factors impacting software quality. A methodology is presented for managing the factors that affect software quality with an illustrative hypothetical example for convenience of application of the proposed methodology. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

## 23 - Revisiting code ownership and its relationship with software quality in the scope of modern code review

### Thongtanunam P., McIntosh S., Hassan A.E., Iida H.

### https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84971482984&doi=10.1145%2f2884781.2884852&partnerID=40&md5=0c2da8fa587f2d260b605b676b5a2c31

Code ownership establishes a chain of responsibility for modules in large software systems. Although prior work uncovers a link between code ownership heuristics and software quality, these heuristics rely solely on the authorship of code changes. In addition to authoring code changes, developers also make important contributions to a module by reviewing code changes. Indeed, recent work shows that reviewers are highly active in modern code review processes, often suggesting alternative solutions or providing updates to the code changes. In this paper, we complement traditional code ownership heuristics using code review activity. Through a case study of six releases of the large Qt and OpenStack systems, we find that: (1) 67%-86% of developers did not author any code changes for a module, but still actively contributed by reviewing 21%-39% of the code changes, (2) code ownership heuristics that are aware of reviewing activity share a relationship with software quality, and (3) the proportion of reviewers without expertise shares a strong, increasing relationship with the likelihood of having post-release defects. Our results suggest that reviewing activity captures an important aspect of code ownership, and should be included in approximations of it in future studies. © 2016 ACM.

## 35 - Quality attribute modeling and quality aware product configuration in software product lines

### Zhang G., Ye H., Lin Y.

### https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84875049200&doi=10.1007%2fs11219-013-9197-z&partnerID=40&md5=ad822ef7f6b285eb153f76658a503708

In software product line engineering, the customers mostly concentrate on the functionalities of the target product during product configuration. The quality attributes of a target product, such as security and performance, are often assessed until the final product is generated. However, it might be very costly to fix the problem if it is found that the generated product cannot satisfy the customers’ quality requirements. Although the quality of a generated product will be affected by all the life cycles of product development, feature-based product configuration is the first stage where the estimation or prediction of the quality attributes should be considered. As we know, the key issue of predicting the quality attributes for a product configured from feature models is to measure the interdependencies between functional features and quality attributes. The current existing approaches have several limitations on this issue, such as requiring real products for the measurement or involving domain experts’ efforts. To overcome these limitations, we propose a systematic approach of modeling quality attributes in feature models based on domain experts’ judgments using the analytic hierarchical process (AHP) and conducting quality aware product configuration based on the captured quality knowledge. Domain experts’ judgments are adapted to avoid generating the real products for quality evaluation, and AHP is used to reduce domain experts’ efforts involved in the judgments. A prototype tool is developed to implement the concepts of the proposed approach, and a formal evaluation is carried out based on a large-scale case study. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

## 38 - Studying the effect of co-change dispersion on software quality

### Kouroshfar E.

### https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84886429987&doi=10.1109%2fICSE.2013.6606741&partnerID=40&md5=f9b5aa44f572315b1cd1c58858d1d1a6

Software change history plays an important role in measuring software quality and predicting defects. Co-change metrics such as number of files changed together has been used as a predictor of bugs. In this study, we further investigate the impact of specific characteristics of co-change dispersion on software quality. Using statistical regression models we show that co-changes that include files from different subsystems result in more bugs than co-changes that include files only from the same subsystem. This can be used to improve bug prediction models based on co-changes. © 2013 IEEE.

## 40 - Normalizing source code vocabulary to support program comprehension and software quality

### Guerrouj L.

### https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84886391532&doi=10.1109%2fICSE.2013.6606723&partnerID=40&md5=191e7233ea6777ff76ebefbf832bbda5

The literature reports that source code lexicon plays a paramount role in program comprehension, especially when software documentation is scarce, outdated or simply not available. In source code, a significant proportion of vocabulary can be either acronyms and-or abbreviations or concatenation of terms that can not be identified using consistent mechanisms such as naming conventions. It is, therefore, essential to disambiguate concepts conveyed by identifiers to support program comprehension and reap the full benefit of Information Retrieval-based techniques (e.g., feature location and traceability) whose linguistic information (i.e., source code identifiers and comments) used across all software artifacts (e.g., requirements, design, change requests, tests, and source code) must be consistent. To this aim, we propose source code vocabulary normalization approaches that exploit contextual information to align the vocabulary found in the source code with that found in other software artifacts. We were inspired in the choice of context levels by prior works and by our findings. Normalization consists of two tasks: splitting and expansion of source code identifiers. We also investigate the effect of source code vocabulary normalization approaches on software maintenance tasks. Results of our evaluation show that our contextual-aware techniques are accurate and efficient in terms of computation time than state of the art alternatives. In addition, our findings reveal that feature location techniques can benefit from vocabulary normalization when no dynamic information is available. © 2013 IEEE.

## 41 - Fostering software quality assessment

### Brandtner M.

### https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84886382849&doi=10.1109%2fICSE.2013.6606725&partnerID=40&md5=9e042076903be6351b3b97be6a877cb3

Software quality assessment shall monitor and guide the evolution of a system based on quality measurements. This continuous process should ideally involve multiple stakeholders and provide adequate information for each of them to use. We want to support an effective selection of quality measurements based on the type of software and individual information needs of the involved stakeholders. We propose an approach that brings together quality measurements and individual information needs for a context-sensitive tailoring of information related to a software quality assessment. We address the following research question: How can we better support different stakeholders in the quality assessment of a software system? For that we will devise theories, models, and prototypes to capture their individual information needs, tailor information from software repositories to these needs, and enable a contextual analysis of the quality aspects. Such a context-sensitive tailoring will provide a effective and individual view on the latest development trends in a project. We outline the milestones as well as evaluation approaches in this paper. © 2013 IEEE.

## 44 - Enhancing defect tracking systems to facilitate software quality improvement

### Li J., Stalhane T., Conradi R., Kristiansen J.M.W.

For projects that rely on empirical process control and deliver frequently working versions of software, developers and project managers regularly need to examine the status of their software quality. This study illustrates that simple goal-oriented changes or extensions to the existing data of projects' respective defect tracking systems could provide valuable and prompt information to improve their software quality assessment and assurance. © 2012 IEEE.

## 47 - Strategy to improve quality for software applications: A process view

### Becker P., Lew P., Olsina L.

### https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79960589413&doi=10.1145%2f1987875.1987897&partnerID=40&md5=697727eaef77cbebdc3618cbb98affc8

Each organization devoted to developing software/web applications should have as one of its ultimate goals to improve the quality in use of its products. In order to accomplish this, first it has to understand the quality of the current product version and then make appropriate changes to increase the quality of the new version if improvement actions were needed. For this purpose, we have developed a specific strategy called SIQinU (Strategy for understanding and Improving Quality in Use), which allows recognizing problems of quality in use through evaluation and proposes product improvements by understanding and making changes on product attributes. Hence by re-evaluating quality in use of the new version, improvement gains can be gauged. SIQinU is in alignment with GOCAME (Goal-Oriented Context-Aware Measurement and Evaluation), a multi-purpose generic strategy previously developed for measurement and evaluation which relies on: a conceptual framework (with ontological base), a process, and methods and tools. Since the process aspect is paramount in defining SIQinU - given the amount of phases and activities - in this paper we model the functional and behavioral process views illustrating them with excerpts of a real case study. © 2011 ACM.

## 50 - Pragmatic prioritization of software quality assurance efforts

### Shihab E.

### https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79959864680&doi=10.1145%2f1985793.1986007&partnerID=40&md5=0e2ecdae077441ec1422a8aaa4bbf673

A plethora of recent work leverages historical data to help practitioners better prioritize their software quality assurance efforts. However, the adoption of this prior work in practice remains low. In our work, we identify a set of challenges that need to be addressed to make previous work on quality assurance prioritization more pragmatic. We outline four guidelines that address these challenges to make prior work on software quality assurance more pragmatic: 1) Focused Granularity (i.e., small prioritization units), 2) Timely Feedback (i.e., results can be acted on in a timely fashion), 3) Estimate Effort (i.e., estimate the time it will take to complete tasks), and 4) Evaluate Generality (i.e., evaluate findings across multiple projects and multiple domains). We present two approaches, at the code and change level, that demonstrate how prior approaches can be more pragmatic. © 2011 Author.

## 53 - A framework for evaluating quality-driven self-adaptive software systems

### Villegas N.M., Müller H.A., Tamura G., Duchien L., Casallas R.

### https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79959550156&doi=10.1145%2f1988008.1988020&partnerID=40&md5=87328f5539e05de7c67c753109f03509

Over the past decade the dynamic capabilities of self-adaptive software-intensive systems have proliferated and improved significantly. To advance the field of self-adaptive and self-managing systems further and to leverage the benefits of self-adaptation, we need to develop methods and tools to assess and possibly certify adaptation properties of self-adaptive systems, not only at design time but also, and especially, at run-time. In this paper we propose a framework for evaluating quality-driven self-adaptive software systems. Our framework is based on a survey of self-adaptive system papers and a set of adaptation properties derived from control theory properties. We also establish a mapping between these properties and software quality attributes. Thus, corresponding software quality metrics can then be used to assess adaptation properties. © 2011 ACM.

## 56 - Concurrency design patterns, software quality attributes and their tactics

### Zheng J., Harper K.E.

### https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77954570582&doi=10.1145%2f1808954.1808964&partnerID=40&md5=46cfdf02f74de1d4d8809d601743a0e5

With the prevalent application of multi-core CPUs, software practitioners are facing the challenge of developing high quality multi-threaded programs. Applying concurrency design patterns is one of the best practices in multi-core software engineering. We comprehensively surveyed 28 concurrency design patterns, and provided a problem-oriented guide that navigates software developers towards the "right" pattern(s) with minimal search/reading effort. The guide also illustrates the relationship between concurrency design patterns and the quality attributes they address. Additionally, further investigation was conducted on how these concurrency design patterns implement quality attributes tactics. We present a mapping between surveyed concurrency design patterns and the tactics for two important quality attributes: performance and modifiability. The results of these studies provide an insight into concurrency design patterns for software developers who are seeking appropriate or improved solutions to multi-threaded software development issues. © 2010 ACM.

## 57 - When process data quality affects the number of bugs: Correlations in software engineering datasets

### Bachmann A., Bernstein A.

### https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77953774300&doi=10.1109%2fMSR.2010.5463286&partnerID=40&md5=8998845e532edbb8dc25941ad5697894

Software engineering process information extracted from version control systems and bug tracking databases are widely used in empirical software engineering. In prior work, we showed that these data are plagued by quality deficiencies, which vary in its characteristics across projects. In addition, we showed that those deficiencies in the form of bias do impact the results of studies in empirical software engineering. While these findings affect software engineering researchers the impact on practitioners has not yet been substantiated. In this paper we, therefore, explore (i) if the process data quality and characteristics have an influence on the bug fixing process and (ii) if the process quality as measured by the process data has an influence on the product (i.e., software) quality. Specifically, we analyze six Open Source as well as two Closed Source projects and show that process data quality and characteristics have an impact on the bug fixing process: the high rate of empty commit messages in Eclipse, for example, correlates with the bug report quality. We also show that the product quality - measured by number of bugs reported - is affected by process data quality measures. These findings have the potential to prompt practitioners to increase the quality of their software process and its associated data quality. © 2010 IEEE.

## 59 - A fuzzy regression and optimization approach for setting target levels in software quality function deployment

### Sener Z., Karsak E.E.

### https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77953480593&doi=10.1007%2fs11219-010-9095-6&partnerID=40&md5=90014463ba282d5a711f45572e77d3c0

With the rapid development of the software industry, improving the quality of software development has gained increasing importance. Software manufacturers have recently applied quality improvement techniques to software development to respond to the needs for software quality. Software quality function deployment (SQFD), as a technique for improving the quality of the software development process to create products responsive to customer expectations, is used to maximize customer satisfaction. This paper presents a fuzzy regression and optimization approach to determine target levels in SQFD. The inherent fuzziness of relationships in SQFD modeling justifies the use of fuzzy regression. Fuzzy regression is used to identify the functional relationships between customer requirements and technical attributes, and among technical attributes. Then, a mathematical programming model is developed to determine target levels of technical attributes using the functional relationships obtained by fuzzy regression. A search engine quality improvement problem is presented to illustrate the application of the proposed approach. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.
