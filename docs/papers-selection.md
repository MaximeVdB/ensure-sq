Industrial software systems are being increasingly developed by large and distributed teams. Tools like collaborative development environments (CDE) are used to facilitate interaction between members of such teams, with the expectation that social factors around the interaction would facilitate team functioning. In this paper, we first identify typically social characteristics of interaction in a software development team: reachability, connection, association, and clustering. We then examine how these factors relate to the quality of software produced by a team, in terms of the number of defects, through an empirical study of 70+ teams, involving 900+ developers in total, spread across 30+ locations and 19 time-zones, working on 40,000+ units of work in the multi-version development of a major industrial product, spreading across more than five years. After controlling for known factors affecting large scale distributed development such as dependency, system age, developer expertise and experience, geographic dispersion, socio-technical congruence, and the number of files changed, we find statistically significant effects of connection and clustering on software quality. Higher levels of intra-team connection are found to relate to higher defect count, whereas more clustering relates to fewer defects. We examine the implications of these results for individual developers, project managers, and organizations. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

## 11 - Software quality through the eyes of the end-user and static analysis tools: A study on Android OSS applications

### Srisopha K., Alfayez R.

### https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85051522416&doi=10.1145%2f3194095.3194096&partnerID=40&md5=7a9dc5d4116e134e2a85128cb3328d90

Source code analysis tools have been the vehicle for measuring and assessing the quality of a software product for decades. However, recently many studies have shown that post-deployment end-user reviews provide a wealth of insight into the quality of a software product and how it should evolve and be maintained. For example, end-user reviews help to identify missing features or inform developers about incorrect or unexpected software behavior. We believe that analyzing end-user reviews and utilizing analysis tools are a crucial step towards understanding the complete picture of the quality of a software product, as well as towards reasoning about the evolution history of it. In this paper, we investigate whether both methods correlate with one another. In other words, we explore if there exists a relationship between user satisfaction and the application's internal quality characteristics. To conduct our research, we analyze a total of 46 actual releases of three Android open source software (OSS) applications on the Google Play Store. For each release, we employ multiple static analysis tools to assess several aspects of the application's software quality. We retrieve and manually analyze the complete reviews after each release of each application from its store page, totaling 1004 reviews. Our initial results suggest that having high or low code quality does not necessary ensure user overall satisfaction. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

## 34 - Introduction of static quality analysis in small- and medium-sized software enterprises: experiences from technology transfer

### Gleirscher M., Golubitskiy D., Irlbeck M., Wagner S.

### https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84927804487&doi=10.1007%2fs11219-013-9217-z&partnerID=40&md5=96b5166ac6f386a4db36845b014b836d

Today, small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the software industry face major challenges. Their resource constraints require high efficiency in development. Furthermore, quality assurance (QA) measures need to be taken to mitigate the risk of additional, expensive effort for bug fixes or compensations. Automated static analysis (ASA) can reduce this risk because it promises low application effort. SMEs seem to take little advantage of this opportunity. Instead, they still mainly rely on the dynamic analysis approach of software testing. In this article, we report on our experiences from a technology transfer project. Our aim was to evaluate the results static analysis can provide for SMEs as well as the problems that occur when introducing and using static analysis in SMEs. We analysed five software projects from five collaborating SMEs using three different ASA techniques: code clone detection, bug pattern detection and architecture conformance analysis. Following the analysis, we applied a quality model to aggregate and evaluate the results. Our study shows that the effort required to introduce ASA techniques in SMEs is small (mostly below one person-hour each). Furthermore, we encountered only few technical problems. By means of the analyses, we could detect multiple defects in production code. The participating companies perceived the analysis results to be a helpful addition to their current QA and will include the analyses in their QA process. With the help of the Quamoco quality model, we could efficiently aggregate and rate static analysis results. However, we also encountered a partial mismatch with the opinions of the SMEs. We conclude that ASA and quality models can be a valuable and affordable addition to the QA process of SMEs. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013.

## 3 - The sustainability of quality in free and open source software

### Alami A.

### https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85094174322&doi=10.1145%2f3377812.3381402&partnerID=40&md5=afb03b21ee1d83333f142cfdf9d75b14

We learned from the history of software that great software are theones who manage to sustain their quality. Free and open sourcesoftware (FOSS) has become a serious software supply channel.However, trust on FOSS products is still an issue. Quality is a traitthat enhances trust. In my study, I investigate the following question: how do FOSS communities sustain their software quality? Iargue that human and social factors contribute to the sustainabilityof quality in FOSS communities. Amongst these factors are: themotivation of participants, robust governance style for the software change process, and the exercise of good practices in the pullrequests evaluation process. © 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

## 13 - A critical review of "a practical guide to select quality indicators for assessing pareto-based search algorithms in search-based software engineering": Essay on quality indicator selection for SBSE

### Li M., Chen T., Yao X.

### https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85049805170&doi=10.1145%2f3183399.3183405&partnerID=40&md5=cf1c999ddeb3da395195f2ba42440d27

This paper presents a critical review of the work published at ICSE'2016 on a practical guide of quality indicator selection for assessing multiobjective solution sets in search-based software engineering (SBSE). This review has two goals. First, we aim at explaining why we disagree with the work at ICSE'2016 and why the reasons behind this disagreement are important to the SBSE community. Second, we aim at providing a more clarified guide of quality indicator selection, serving as a new direction on this particular topic for the SBSE community. In particular, we argue that it does matter which quality indicator to select, whatever in the same quality category or across different categories. This claim is based upon the fundamental goal of multiobjective optimisation-supplying the decision-maker a set of solutions which are the most consistent with their preferences. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

## 15 - Impact of customization over software quality in ERP projects: an empirical study

### Parthasarathy S., Sharma S.

### https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84964057687&doi=10.1007%2fs11219-016-9314-x&partnerID=40&md5=bbbd3a489ccce59d7785bbfd59804021

Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems are recognized as management information systems that streamline business processes of an enterprise. Delivering ERP software to meet functional needs of an organization with acceptable level of quality is a challenge due to the very nature of development and deployment of this packaged software. Drawing on ISO/IEC 9126’s characterization of software quality and Luo and Strong’s ERP customization framework, this paper analyzes the impact of the ERP system customization on software quality of ERP. A software quality framework for ERP customization has been developed, and three sets of hypotheses have been formulated. A detailed survey was conducted for data collection. The statistical data analysis reveals that module customization does not impact ERP quality, while database and source code customizations have significant influence over ERP quality. Our findings have implications for the implementation of customized ERP in organizations. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

## 16 - Productivity paradoxes revisited: Assessing the relationship between quality maturity levels and labor productivity in brazilian software companies

### C. Duarte C.H.

### https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84989910841&doi=10.1007%2fs10664-016-9453-5&partnerID=40&md5=c4582eabccfbbf9c77fc764b7dd8fa00

The adoption of quality assurance methods based on software process improvement models has been regarded as an important source of variability in software productivity. Some companies perceive that their implementation has prohibitive costs, whereas some authors identify in their use a way to comply with software development patterns and standards, produce economic value and lead to corporate performance improvement. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between quality maturity levels and labor productivity, using a data set containing 687 Brazilian software firms. We study here the relationship between labor productivity, as measured through the annual gross revenue per worker ratio, and quality levels, which were appraised from 2006 to 2012 according to two distinct software process improvement models: MPS.BR and CMMI. We perform independent statistical tests using appraisals carried out according to each of these models, consequently obtaining a data set with as many observations as possible, in order to seek strong support for our research. We first show that MPS.BR and CMMI appraised quality maturity levels are correlated, but we find no statistical evidence that they are related to higher labor productivity or productivity growth. On the contrary, we present evidence suggesting that average labor productivity is higher in software companies without appraised quality levels. Moreover, our analyses suggest that companies with appraised quality maturity levels are more or less productive depending on factors such as their business nature, main origin of capital and maintained quality level. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

## 19 - An empirical study of the impact of modern code review practices on software quality

### McIntosh S., Kamei Y., Adams B., Hassan A.E.

### https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84928384936&doi=10.1007%2fs10664-015-9381-9&partnerID=40&md5=4ccadde0c9552d2747cfa6bdf80ff3ca

Software code review, i.e., the practice of having other team members critique changes to a software system, is a well-established best practice in both open source and proprietary software domains. Prior work has shown that formal code inspections tend to improve the quality of delivered software. However, the formal code inspection process mandates strict review criteria (e.g., in-person meetings and reviewer checklists) to ensure a base level of review quality, while the modern, lightweight code reviewing process does not. Although recent work explores the modern code review process, little is known about the relationship between modern code review practices and long-term software quality. Hence, in this paper, we study the relationship between post-release defects (a popular proxy for long-term software quality) and: (1) code review coverage, i.e., the proportion of changes that have been code reviewed, (2) code review participation, i.e., the degree of reviewer involvement in the code review process, and (3) code reviewer expertise, i.e., the level of domain-specific expertise of the code reviewers. Through a case study of the Qt, VTK, and ITK projects, we find that code review coverage, participation, and expertise share a significant link with software quality. Hence, our results empirically confirm the intuition that poorly-reviewed code has a negative impact on software quality in large systems using modern reviewing tools. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

## 21 - Improving and balancing software qualities

### Boehm B.

### https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85026633467&doi=10.1145%2f2889160.2891049&partnerID=40&md5=6d99ef500aabca2de5eabfb37df2b2d4

This Technical Briefing describes the nature of Software Qualities (SQs), ilities, or non-functional requirements (reliability, usability, affordability, etc.), and discusses the importance of understanding their nature and interrelationships, and of bringing them into balance in the practice of software engineering. The relevance and timeliness of this topic reflects the current and future trends toward more software-intensive systems, with greater complexity, autonomy, speed of change, and need for interoperability within systems of systems, given the frequent system shortfalls and overruns that occur when their SQ balance is not achieved. It discusses the weaknesses of current SQ standards and guidance, and summarizes research toward strengthening current SQ definitions and relationships. This includes a set of initial SQ ontology elements and relationships, examples of their application to some key SQs, an identification of further research and development needed to make the ontology fully useful and evolvable, and the nature of an international collaborative effort to help improve current practices via a Qualipedia for accessing the evolving body of knowledge for improving SQ engineering. © 2016 Author.

## 24 - A practical guide to select quality indicators for assessing pareto-based search algorithms in search-based software engineering

### Wang S., Ali S., Yue T., Li Y., Liaaen M.

### https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84971412816&doi=10.1145%2f2884781.2884880&partnerID=40&md5=fb106f940fea5f845deddb5ac287de81

Many software engineering problems are multi-objective in nature, which has been largely recognized by the Search-based Software Engineering (SBSE) community. In this regard, Paretobased search algorithms, e.g., Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II, have already shown good performance for solving multi-objective optimization problems. These algorithms produce Pareto fronts, where each Pareto front consists of a set of nondominated solutions. Eventually, a user selects one or more of the solutions from a Pareto front for their specific problems. A key challenge of applying Pareto-based search algorithms is to select appropriate quality indicators, e.g., hypervolume, to assess the quality of Pareto fronts. Based on the results of an extended literature review, we found that the current literature and practice in SBSE lacks a practical guide for selecting quality indicators despite a large number of published SBSE works. In this direction, the paper presents a practical guide for the SBSE community to select quality indicators for assessing Pareto-based search algorithms in different software engineering contexts. The practical guide is derived from the following complementary theoretical and empirical methods: 1) key theoretical foundations of quality indicators; 2) evidence from an extended literature review; and 3) evidence collected from an extensive experiment that was conducted to evaluate eight quality indicators from four different categories with six Pareto-based search algorithms using three real industrial problems from two diverse domains. © 2016 ACM.

How can organizational factors such as structure and culture have an impact on the working conditions of developers? This study is based on ten months of observation of an in-house software development project within a large telecommunications company. The observation was conducted during mandatory weekly status meetings, where technical and managerial issues were raised and discussed. Preliminary results show that many decisions made under the pressure of certain organizational factors negatively affected software quality. This paper describes cases depicting the complexity of organizational factors and reports on ten issues that have had a negative impact on quality, followed by suggested avenues for corrective action. © 2015 IEEE.
