This research abstract presents two approaches for utilizing the developers' subjective design quality evaluations during the software lifecycle. In process-based approach developers study and improve their system's structure at fixed intervals. Tool-based approach uses subjective evaluations as input to tool analysis. These approaches or their combination are expected to improve software design and promote organizational learning about software design.

A user survey was carried out to evaluate empirically ISO/IEC 9126's dimensionality, or the classification of characteristics, and internal- consistency reliability. In the survey, users evaluated their satisfaction concerning the quality of a packaged software product according to the criteria of ISO/IEC 9126's subcharacteristics. Overall, results reveal ambiguities in the way that ISO/IEC 9126 is structured in terms of characteristics and subcharacteristics.

# 102 - Requirements engineering and process modelling in software quality management - Towards a generic process metamodel

## Berki E., Georgiadou E., Holcombe M.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-3142676780&doi=10.1023%2fB%3aSQJO.0000034711.87241.f0&partnerID=40&md5=57a51d22bc656cff90603f0d24ae4251

This paper examines the concept of Quality in Software Engineering, its different contexts and its different meanings to various people. It begins with a commentary on quality issues for systems development and various stakeholders' involvement. It revisits aspects and concepts of systems development methods and highlights the relevance of quality issues to the choice of a process model. A summarised review of some families of methods is presented, where their application domain, lifecycle coverage, strengths and weaknesses are considered. Under the new development era the requirements of software development change; the role of methods and stakeholders change, too. The paper refers to the latest developments in the area of software engineering and emphasises the shift from traditional conceptual modelling to requirements engineering and process metamodelling principles. We provide support for an emerging discipline in the form of a software process metamodel to cover new issues for software quality and process improvement. The widening of the horizons of software engineering both as a 'communication tool' and as a 'scientific discipline' (and not as a 'craft') is needed in order to support both communicative and scientific quality systems properties. In general, we can consider such a discipline as a thinking tool for understanding the generic process and as the origin of combining intuition and quality engineering to transform requirements to adequate human-centred information systems. We conclude with a schematic representation of a Generic Process Metamodel (GPM) indicating facets contributed by Software Engineering, Computer Science, Information Systems, Mathematics, Linguistics, Sociology and Anthropology. Ongoing research and development issues have provided evidence for influence from even more diverse disciplines.

# 103 - New Year's Resolutions for Software Quality

## Eickelmann N., Hayes J.H.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0742321099&doi=10.1109%2fMS.2004.1259165&partnerID=40&md5=08f115ebac6c5ed6aef53692c3b445eb

The views of various individuals on improvement of software quality are presented. Victor R.Basili stated that software organizations should observe and analyze their software development processes and products. One of the creators of software reliability engineering expressed that these organizations must recognize that users view product quality as the trade-off among reliability, time of delivery and cost that best needs, given the way in which they expect to use the product. Some of the researchers recognized that testing software is as important as writing.

# 104 - Analogy-Based Practical Classification Rules for Software Quality Estimation

## Khoshgoftaar T.M., Seliya N.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0141924286&doi=10.1023%2fA%3a1025316301168&partnerID=40&md5=c55c23db4d307f95d3a30705f91b2729

Software metrics-based quality estimation models can be effective tools for identifying which modules are likely to be fault-prone or not fault-prone. The use of such models prior to system deployment can considerably reduce the likelihood of faults discovered during operations, hence improving system reliability. A software quality classification model is calibrated using metrics from a past release or similar project, and is then applied to modules currently under development. Subsequently, a timely prediction of which modules are likely to have faults can be obtained. However, software quality classification models used in practice may not provide a useful balance between the two misclassification rates, especially when there are very few faulty modules in the system being modeled. This paper presents, in the context of case-based reasoning, two practical classification rules that allow appropriate emphasis on each type of misclassification as per the project requirements. The suggested techniques are especially useful for high-assurance systems where faulty modules are rare. The proposed generalized classification methods emphasize on the costs of misclassifications, and the unbalanced distribution of the faulty program modules. We illustrate the proposed techniques with a case study that consists of software measurements and fault data collected over multiple releases of a large-scale legacy telecommunication system. In addition to investigating the two classification methods, a brief relative comparison of the techniques is also presented. It is indicated that the level of classification accuracy and model-robustness observed for the case study would be beneficial in achieving high software reliability of its subsequent system releases. Similar observations are made from our empirical studies with other case studies.

# 105 - Trade-offs between productivity and quality in selecting software development practices

## MacCormack A., Kemerer C.F., Cusumano M., Crandall B.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0141502244&doi=10.1109%2fMS.2003.1231158&partnerID=40&md5=aba6974e2c7b9358f2447dd164332285

Choosing appropriate practices for a project can be hard, given the various dimensions of performance each claims to optimize. Using data from 29 projects, the impact of eight development practices on both productivity and quality was examined. The overall results showed that at the beginning of each project, practitioners should establish the primary performance objectives for the software deliverable, given that these will largely drive the type of development model and mix of practices they should use.

# 106 - Fault prediction modeling for software quality estimation: Comparing commonly used techniques

## Khoshgoftaar T.M., Seliya N.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0042767590&doi=10.1023%2fA%3a1024424811345&partnerID=40&md5=4f15d83ee9b1408272d2b79e7a2ea851

High-assurance and complex mission-critical software systems are heavily dependent on reliability of their underlying software applications. An early software fault prediction is a proven technique in achieving high software reliability. Prediction models based on software metrics can predict number of faults in software modules. Timely predictions of such models can be used to direct cost-effective quality enhancement efforts to modules that are likely to have a high number of faults. We evaluate the predictive performance of six commonly used fault prediction techniques: CART-LS (least squares), CART-LAD (least absolute deviation), S-PLUS, multiple linear regression, artificial neural networks, and case-based reasoning. The case study consists of software metrics collected over four releases of a very large telecommunications system. Performance metrics, average absolute and average relative errors, are utilized to gauge the accuracy of different prediction models. Models were built using both, original software metrics (RAW) and their principle components (PCA). Two-way ANOVA randomized-complete block design models with two blocking variables are designed with average absolute and average relative errors as response variables. System release and the model type (RAW or PCA) form the blocking variables and the prediction technique is treated as a factor. Using multiple-pairwise comparisons, the performance order of prediction models is determined. We observe that for both average absolute and average relative errors, the CART-LAD model performs the best while the S-PLUS model is ranked sixth.

# 107 - GEQUAMO - A generic, multilayered, customisable, software quality model

## Georgiadou E.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-3543133647&doi=10.1023%2fA%3a1025817312035&partnerID=40&md5=badb2f8c8a55653a96fec05d28815c48

Software quality models have primarily been based on top down process improvement approaches. Such models are based on the fundamental principle of empowerment of all involved and foster a questioning attitude through the active exchange of ideas and criticism ensuring that the most appropriate approach for quality improvements is adopted. The holistic view of systems enables the incorporation of many viewpoints held by different parties within the same organisation and by the same party at different stages of development. In this paper the GEQUAMO (GEneric, multilayered and customisable) QUAlity MOdel is proposed. GEQUAMO encapsulates the requirements of different stakeholders in a dynamic and flexible manner so as to enable each stakeholder (developer, user or sponsor) to construct their own model reflecting the emphasis/weighting for each attribute/requirement. Using a combination of the CFD (Composite Features Diagramming Technique) developed by the author, and Kiviat diagrams a multilayered and dynamic model is constructed. Instances of models are presented together with the algorithm for the computation of the profiles. Indications of future work conclude the paper.

# 108 - Construction of a systemic quality model for evaluating a software product

## Ortega M., Pérez M., Rojas T.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-3543054780&doi=10.1023%2fA%3a1025166710988&partnerID=40&md5=f6915840807fb5204c5c331644d47524

Quality is currently considered one of the main assets with which a firm can enhance its competitive global position. This is one reason why quality has become essential for ensuring that a company's products and processes meet customers' needs. A recent innovation in the systems area is the development of a set of mechanisms and models for evaluating quality. This article describes the design of a Quality Model with a systemic approach to software products that assesses a product's efficiency and effectiveness. Different quality models were studied: McCall, Boehm, FURPS, ISO 9126, Dromey, ISO 15504 in an attempt to identify the aspects present in these models that are deemed important in a Systemic Quality model. We designed a model prototype that reflects the essential attributes of quality. This model was evaluated using a method so it can be validated and also enhanced. The evaluation method consisted of: designing a survey, formulating, validating and applying the measurement instruments; defining an algorithm to obtain the quality estimate and analyzing the results. The model prototype enabled the strengths and weaknesses of the software products studied to be identified. When evaluating a software product using the model prototype, it was possible to ascertain its compliance with the standards and use the results to improve it. Since the evaluation was systemic, processes that affect certain characteristics of the product could be identified. Companies can benefit from the model proposed because it serves as a benchmark that allows their products to evolve and be competitive.

# 109 - Empirical Measurement of the Effects of Cultural Diversity on Software Quality Management

## Siakas K.V., Georgiadou E.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-1842856193&doi=10.1023%2fA%3a1020528024624&partnerID=40&md5=b57d9bcaf695665006cda2cc42988471

The difficulties of achieving social acceptance for Software Quality Management systems have been underestimated in the past, and they will be exacerbated in the future by the globalization of the software market and the increasing use of cross-cultural development teams within multinational companies. Management that can take account of the cultural context of their endeavours will improve understanding, minimize risk and ensure a higher degree of success in improvement programs within the software industry. This paper addresses cross-cultural issues in Software Quality Management. Qualitative and quantitative research was carried out in five European countries by using a postal questionnaire. Empirical measures of organizational culture, national culture and their interdependence, are presented together with interim instruments developed for the purpose of classifying organizations. Verification of the statistical results from the survey was carried out by triangulation, which included qualitative research methods in the form of interviews and observation. Cultural factors, which may have bearing on successful adoption and implementation of Software Quality Management were identified, and an assessment model, has been developed for use by organizations developing software in different parts of the world. The intention is that the recommendations following from the assessment will lead to greater cultural awareness in addressing quality, and will provide stimulus for improvement. The model's aims is to predict to what degree there is a fit between the organizational and the national culture, and to give recommendations and guidelines for software process improvement.

# 111 - Examining the Effect of the Transformational Leader on Software Quality

## Parzinger M.J., Nath R., Lemons M.A.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0042547833&doi=10.1023%2fA%3a1013763119819&partnerID=40&md5=7d31b7d93f78b6c4d5642bf4db7bae43

Developing and maintaining quality software is paramount in the information-intensive society. A myriad of concepts, tools and techniques exist that can be employed to improve the quality of software and at the same time increase developmental efficiencies. Approaches used by many software development units include: Capability Maturity Model (CMM), Total Quality Management (TQM), and ISO 9000-3. Implementation of these approaches without appropriate management oversight does not guarantee success. This study examines the role of the manager vis-à-vis "leadership style" with software quality. Data collected using a questionnaire administered to members of the American Society for Quality (ASQ) - Software Division, suggest that the Transformational leadership style of the manager has a significant positive relationship with the quality of the software developed.

# 112 - Multi-Criteria Methodology Contribution to the Software Quality Evaluation

## Blin M.-J., Tsoukiàs A.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0011893888&doi=10.1023%2fA%3a1016626919680&partnerID=40&md5=a137d99a58bbb4836370b1d4ff3554bc

Industrial evaluations of COTS software largely used the quality models provided by the international standards. But the context and objectives of COTS evaluations are fundamentally different than those primarily defined by the standards. Several key issues are often forgotten: (1) the existence of several evaluators and several quality models sharing common factors, criteria and measures, (2) the purpose of the evaluation model, (3) measures of different types, and (4) the recursive nature of the model since each node is an evaluation model itself. We had the occasion to study the results of real standard-based COTS evaluations. Faced with the difficulties to exploit them, we experimented the use of multi-criteria methodology. This work allows us to understand some of the problems generated by the application of the standards to COTS evaluations, and to propose new principles for evaluating software quality that should be considered in an evolution of the standards. This paper reports our experiment.

# 113 - Quality through Managed Improvement and Measurement (QMIM): Towards a Phased Development and Implementation of a Quality Management System for a Software Company

## Balla K., Bemelmans T., Kusters R., Trienekens J.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0010645865&doi=10.1023%2fA%3a1013301503616&partnerID=40&md5=cfe9889727ca12badee4d71ce1c02868

The paper describes results of a longitudinal study of developments in the area of software product and process quality improvement within a Hungarian software company, IQSOFT Ltd. This company has been active in this area since 1993, trying to build, introduce and maintain an efficiently working quality management system which, e.g., fulfils the ISO 9001 requirements, allows steady software process improvement and, at the same time, conforms to company's own needs. Over the last eight years five phases could be distinguished. Each phase is described shortly, following the same structure, namely: basic starting points, key problem areas, literature consulted, activities and design executed, reflections on what happened and why. The lessons resulting from the analysis of this case have been formulated in terms of guidelines. We feel that these are applicable to any low maturity software development organisation embarking on a product or process quality improvement endeavour. These guidelines are developed around a framework containing the basic issues of software production (project management, technical processes and products). The guidelines advocate a careful step-by-step development of definitions, quality characteristics, and metrics related to these objects while at the same time developing and introducing the associated process.

# 114 - Method for software quality planning, control, and evaluation

## Boegh Jorgen, Depanfilis Stefano, Kitchenham Barbara, Pasquini Alberto

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0033097512&doi=10.1109%2f52.754056&partnerID=40&md5=97fc63f1814469a1306aed28d10729d6

An increasing number of software process and product standards emphasize the need for measurement. ISO 9001, for example, provides guidance for monitoring and controlling product and process characteristics during both production and installation. However, standards provide little guidance as to what exactly users should measure and how to use the results to support the development of high-quality software. Furthermore, measurement cannot be defined independent of context. A metric set judged valid on one project may lead to poor quality or high development costs when applied to another project. When quality is measured, several factors come into play, including product characteristics (such as size), process maturity level of the company developing the software product, its development environment (such as the design methodology and CASE tools used), and the development team's skill and experience.

# 115 - A quality software process for rapid application development

## Coleman G., Verbruggen R.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0542397516&doi=10.1023%2fA%3a1008856624790&partnerID=40&md5=f6924e80eaf9d9671e402727a974b77f

Software organizations can significantly improve the quality of their output if they have a defined and documented software process, together with the appropriate techniques and tools to measure its effectiveness. Without a defined process it is impossible to measure success or focus on how development capability can be enhanced. To date, a number of software process improvement frameworks have been developed and implemented. However, most of these models have been targeted at large-scale producers. Furthermore, they have applied to companies who use traditional development techniques. Smaller companies and those operating in development areas where speed of delivery is paramount have not, as yet, had process improvement paradigms available for adoption. This study examined the software process in a small company and emerged with the recommendation of the use of the Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM) and the Personal Software Process (PSP) for achieving software process improvement.

# 116 - Software quality analysis & measurement service activity in the company

## Tanaka Takeshi, Aizawa Minoru, Ogasawara Hideto, Yamada Atsushi

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0031597187&doi=10.1109%2fICSE.1998.671598&partnerID=40&md5=377b5ac3a4b038bfd392e01d4e7c6600

It is very important to improve software quality using program analysis & measurement tools and SQA (Software Quality Assurance) method at the appropriate points during the process of development. But in many development departments, there is often not enough time to evaluate and use the tools and SQA method or to accumulate the know-how for effective use. This paper describes the support activity of a software quality analysis & measurement service which is performed by our team of laboratory within the company as a third-party independent staff group. We call this activity HQC (High Quality software creation support virtual Center). The purpose of this activity is as follows. First we improve the software quality engineering process in the development department, for example, we help them to increase efficiency of review or testing. To accomplish this, we use program static analysis tools to detect fault-prone software components. Next we assist in starting their own self-improvement process. In addition, we provide service activity to many development departments concurrently. We have been making progress with these activities, and some development departments have begun to establish improvement process themselves.

# 117 - Perceptions of software quality : A pilot study

## Wilson D.N., Hall T.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0011653418&doi=10.1023%2fb%3asqjo.0000042060.88173.fe&partnerID=40&md5=e24784f5ffa40aba778cfd835e019d2a

Many software quality initiatives fail because they do not take account of the range of views that people have of quality. New approaches to software quality improvement will not work unless software developers believe in them, no matter how enthusiastic managers may be. This paper reports on a pilot study using the repertory grid technique that found evidence to support these assertions. The study findings justify further work and show that while the repertory grid technique is an appropriate instrument in this area it is resource intensive to apply and may not be practical in a wider study of a representative sample of the IT industry. The paper has practical recommendations for successful introduction of new software quality programmes. These recommendations stress the need for effective communication, leading to a shared understanding of 'quality', and for realistic goals that recognize the pressure of development schedules. © 1998 Chapman & Hall.

# 118 - A critical look at ISO 9000 for software quality management

## Stelzer D., Mellis W., Herzwurm G.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0642363924&doi=10.1023%2fA%3a1018591430752&partnerID=40&md5=9181348bb75865be23649ef29338594f

A considerable number of software suppliers report improvements in product and service quality, development costs and time to market achieved with the help of the ISO 9000 standards. Nevertheless, the ISO 9000 family has received unfavourable criticism in journals, textbooks and at software quality conferences. The paper summarizes, discusses and reviews eleven of the most popular arguments against the ISO 9000 standards. The review of the criticism is based on findings of two empirical surveys among European software suppliers that have implemented an ISO 9000 quality system. The paper concludes with suggestions and guidelines for advances in software quality management concepts, such as the ISO 9000 family, CMM, BOOTSTRAP and the emerging SPICE standard.

# 119 - Efficiency of CAME tools in software quality assurance

## Dumke R.R., Grigoleit H.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0642333260&doi=10.1023%2fA%3a1018507901618&partnerID=40&md5=0ce0041f30ceaef95ce87fd174655648

Our paper describes the requirements and possibilities of integration of metrics tools in the field of software quality assurance. Tools for the support of the measurement process are herein classified as Computer Assisted Software Measurement and Evaulation Tools (CAME Tools). Software measurement regarded as a special type of metrics application provides a great amount of basic information for the evaluation of the software development process or the software product itself. Our paper examines the effectiveness and destination of software measurement in tool-based software development and is based on an analysis of more than 20 CAME tools in the Software Measurement Laboratory at the University of Magdeburg. CAME tools are useable for the process, product, and resources evaluation in all phases of the software life cycle (including the problem definition) for different development paradigms. The efficiency of CAME tools is described on the basis of a general measurement framework. This framework includes all steps in the software measurement and evaulation process: metrics definition, selection of the evaluation criteria, tool-based modelling and measurement, value presentation and statistical analysis. The framework includes the main aspects of the process evaluation techniques (Capability Maturity Model, ISO 9000-3 etc.) and product evaluation (ISO 9126, etc.). It is not a disjointed set of aspects: our measurement framework represents an incremental technique for the application of quantification of quality aspects in a required quality assurance.
