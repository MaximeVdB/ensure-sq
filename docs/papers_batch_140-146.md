Achieving quality is a perennial problem in software development. It is commercially significant because of the large sums of money spent correcting problems within information systems. The literature shows how various theoretical treatments have developed since the late 1970s. However, many of these models are of academic interest only, because they are not perceived by IT professionals to meet their needs. This article describes a study which examined the nature of quality in six different commercial environments. The aim of the study was to provide models of quality appropriate to individual commercial environments and to examine similarities between them. The results, expressed in terms of quality criteria and the relationships between them, highlight the limitations of many theoretical treatments, in particular, the highly technical view of software quality enshrined in early models, and the need for criteria contributing to 'business correctness'. The results from the study are used to highlight some of the important issues in software quality within commercial environments and some of the reasons why quality is often poor. © 1992 Chapman & Hall.

# 141 - On specifying software quality

## Dromey R.G., McGettrick A.D.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0008302517&doi=10.1007%2fBF01720169&partnerID=40&md5=f297222c53ba1b94f0ae36ebdd761820

Quality is recognized as a pre-eminently important characteristic of software, yet an understanding of how to usefully define it, and how to achieve it remains illusive. A constructive definition of quality is investigated and an approach to the construction of software of quality is suggested. The definition focusses on how well the solution fits the problem, the inherent quality of the design independent of the problem, and the quality of the design process that creates the solution. A constructive specification of software quality then follows based on the use of programming language syntax, design principles and strategies, post-construction program quality analysis systems, and computer-assisted program construction tools. Only by addressing the problem on much broader methodological, technical, and managerial fronts will it be possible to make significant gains in software quality. © 1992 Chapman & Hall.

# 142 - Application of software reliability modeling to product quality and test process

## Ehrlich Willa K., Stampfel John P., Wu Jar R.

Software reliability modeling of data collected during the testing of a large-scale industrial system (System T) was used to measure software quality from the customer perspective. Specifically, software quality was measured in terms of the system operation. The testing phase analyzed, stability test, was an operational profile-driven test in that a controlled load was imposed on the system reflective of the system's busy-hour usage pattern. The usage profile was determined from requirements specifying both the frequency of invocation of each command and the alarm arrival rate for the largest expected user site. For this controlled test environment, a Poisson-type reliability growth model, the exponential nonhomogeneous Poisson process model, exhibited a good fit to the observed failure data. Furthermore, the model demonstrated predictive power for future failure rates. It is concluded that the use of an operational profile to drive system test is an effective test strategy and that the operational profile must be taken into account when predicting field reliability from reliability measured during test.

# 143 - Improving software quality: The use of formal inspections at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory

After surveying detection practices in the best of industry, JPL (Jet Propulstion Laboratory) Software Product Assurance decided that the most cost-effective early defect detection technique was the 'Fagan Inspection' procedure. The author describes this technique, how it was introduced to JPL, some of the difficulties involved in 'transferring technology,' and the first provisional set of results.

The authors introduce quality metrics into the quantitative software quality estimation technique, embracing the quality estimate of design, as well as of the source code, in studying a quality quantification support system. They outline a quality quantification technique for this system, describe examples of both its application to actual projects and its evaluation, and consider its relationship conventional techniques for estimate indexing of T.

# 146 - Quantitative evaluation of software quality

## Boehm B.W., Brown J.R., Lipow M.

The study reported in this paper establishes a conceptual framework and some key initial results in the analysis of the characteristics of software quality. Its main results and conclusions are: • Explicit attention to characteristics of software quality can lead to significant savings in software life-cycle costs. • The current software state-of-the-art imposes specific limitations on our ability to automatically and quantitatively evaluate the quality of software. • A definitive hierarchy of well-defined, well-differentiated characteristics of software quality is developed. Its higher-level structure reflects the actual uses to which software quality evaluation would be put; its lower-level characteristics are closely correlated with actual software metric evaluations which can be performed. • A large number of software quality-evaluation metrics have been defined, classified, and evaluated with respect to their potential benefits, quantifiability, and ease of automation. • Particular software life-cycle activities have been identified which have significant leverage on software quality. Most importantly, we believe that the study reported in this paper provides for the first time a clear, well-defined framework for assessing the often slippery issues associated with software quality, via the consistent and mutually supportive sets of definitions, distinctions, guidelines, and experiences cited. This framework is certainly not complete, but it has been brought to a point sufficient to serve as a viable basis for future refinements and extensions. © 1976 IEEE Computer Society.
