'High quality' might seem an obvious requirement for any piece of software, but do the different stakeholder groups involved in its production and use conceptualize this requirement in the same way? Many existing models refine the broad concept of quality into a number of well-defined and measurable attributes related to the software product itself and the development process which produced it. But despite growing awareness of the importance of achieving cultural alignment between holders of different business and IT groups, little attempt has been made to empirically examine the requirements for software quality held by different groups involved in the development process. We conducted a survey of more than 300 current and recently graduated students of one of the leading Executive MBA programs in the United States, asking them to rate the importance of each of 13 widely-cited attributes related to software quality. The results showed business role-related differences in some specific areas and agreement in many others. The results suggest that a strong shared culture may be able to bridge the gulf created between holders of IT and business stakeholder roles. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

# 61 - Software quality models: Purposes, usage scenarios and requirements

## Deissenboeck F., Juergens E., Lochmann K., Wagner S.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-78049485828&doi=10.1109%2fWOSQ.2009.5071551&partnerID=40&md5=8fcbe52cf221d20710deaf02231c9c19

Software quality models are a well-accepted means to support quality management of software systems. Over the last 30 years, a multitude of quality models have been proposed and applied with varying degrees of success. Despite successes and standardisation efforts, quality models are still being criticised, as their application in practice exhibits various problems. To some extent, this criticism is caused by an unclear definition of what quality models are and which purposes they serve. Beyond this, there is a lack of explicitly stated requirements for quality models with respect to their intended mode of application. To remedy this, this paper describes purposes and usage scenarios of quality models and, based on the literature and experiences from the authors, collects critique of existing models. From this, general requirements for quality models are derived. The requirements can be used to support the evaluation of existing quality models for a given context or to guide further quality model development. © 2009 IEEE.

# 62 - The influence of team relationships on software quality

## Wong B., Bhatti M.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-78049484277&doi=10.1109%2fWOSQ.2009.5071550&partnerID=40&md5=97a6101b529f8645b4d26d29dc2417b2

Implementing software development successfully in an organization is possibly one of the most challenging issues that the industry faces today. Project failures and the lack of software quality have become a major concern for researchers and practitioners. For many software development projects as well as for many quality assurance departments, teamwork is extremely important. Therefore, nearly all organizations pay attention to teamwork which is essential for smooth operation of a project. It is believed that teamwork is crucial for the success or failure of a project. In addition to the importance of teamwork, team issues affecting its' performance also needs attention. Among these team issues, people issues are scarce in the literature. The research outlined in this paper investigated the factors which influence teamwork. It identified the importance of trust and how trust influences IT project teams and the role of project managers and team leaders in improving trust within teams. It also includes individual behaviors that affect trust within a team. A study of six project managers from two Australian organizations was conducted to investigate the factors which influence teamwork to result in project success and software quality. The results showed that trust is a central element of the many factors and that without trust in the team; teamwork will be negatively affected resulting in project failure and poor quality. © 2009 IEEE.

# 63 - Software aging assessment through a specialization of the SQuaRE quality model

## Bombardieri M., Fontana F.A.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-78049458138&doi=10.1109%2fWOSQ.2009.5071554&partnerID=40&md5=3085a2d9022674d883b077f87722de88

In the last years the software application portfolio has become a key asset for almost all companies. During their lives, applications undergo lots of changes to add new functionalities or to refactor older ones; these changes tend to reduce the quality of the applications themselves, causing the phenomenon known as software aging. Monitoring of software aging is very important for companies, but up to now there are no standard approaches to perform this task. In addition many of the suggested models assess software aging basing on few software features, whereas this phenomenon affects all of the software aspects. In 2005 ISO/IEC released the SQuaRE quality model which covers several elements of software quality assessment, but some issues make SQuaRE usage quite difficult. The purpose of this paper is to suggest an approach to software aging monitoring that considers the software product in its wholeness and to provide a specialization of the SQuaRE quality model which allows to perform this task. © 2009 IEEE.

# 64 - Inspection effectiveness for different quality attributes of software requirement specifications: An industrial case study

## Salger F., Engels G., Hofmann A.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77955167159&doi=10.1109%2fWOSQ.2009.5071552&partnerID=40&md5=6f5d87e6b9a0e8abe8256ba0756f9df0

Early inspections of software requirements specifications (SRS) are known to be an effective and cost-efficient quality assurance technique. However, inspections are often applied with the underlying assumption that they work equally well to assess all kinds of quality attributes of SRS. Little work has yet been done to validate this assumption. At Capgemini sd&m, we set up an inspection technique to assess SRS, the so called "specification quality gate" (QG-Spec). The QG-Spec has been applied to a series of large scale commercial projects. In this paper we present our lessons learned and discuss, which quality attributes are effectively assessed by means of the QG-Spec - and which are not. We argue that our results can be generalized to other existing inspection techniques. We came to the conclusion that inspections have to be carefully balanced with techniques for constructive quality assurance in order to economically arrive at high quality SRS. © 2009 IEEE.

# 65 - Alitheia Core: An extensible software quality monitoring platform

## Gousios G., Spinellis D.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77949911315&doi=10.1109%2fICSE.2009.5070560&partnerID=40&md5=8f04e7f1a0aa62127f5fcda026a8e620

Research in the fields of software quality and maintain-ability requires the analysis of large quantities of data, which often originate from open source software projects. Pre-processing data, calculating metrics, and synthesizing composite results from a large corpus of project artefacts is a tedious and error prone task lacking direct scientific value. The Alitheia Core tool is an extensible platform for software quality analysis that is designed specifically to facilitate software engineering research on large and diverse data sources, by integrating data collection and preprocessing phases with an array of analysis services, and presenting the researcher with an easy to use extension mechanism. The system has been used to process several projects successfully, forming the basis of an emerging ecosystem of quality analysis tools. © 2009 IEEE.

# 66 - Does distributed development affect software quality? An empirical case study of windows vista

## Bird C., Nagappan N., Devanbu P., Gall H., Murphy B.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77949887177&doi=10.1109%2fICSE.2009.5070550&partnerID=40&md5=b2268150b63c60366c76b7fa3a7dd644

It is widely believed that distributed software development is riskier and more challenging than collocated development. Prior literature on distributed development in software engineering and other fields discuss various challenges, including cultural barriers, expertise transfer dif-ficulties, and communication and coordination overhead. We evaluate this conventional belief by examining the overall development of Windows Vista and comparing the postrelease failures of components that were developed in a distributed fashion with those that were developed by collocated teams. We found a negligible difference in failures. This difference becomes even less significant when controlling for the number of developers working on a binary. We also examine component characteristics such as code churn, complexity, dependency information, and test code coverage and find very little difference between distributed and collocated components to investigate if less complex components are more distributed. Further, we examine the software process and phenomena that occurred during the Vista development cycle and present ways in which the development process utilized may be insensitive to geography by mitigating the difficulties introduced in prior work in this area. © 2009 IEEE.

# 67 - Improving Software quality via code searching and mining

Enormous amount of open source code is available on the Internet and various code search engines (CSE) are available to serve as a means for searching in open source code. However, usage of CSEs is often limited to simple tasks such as searching for relevant code examples. In this paper, we present a generic life-cycle model that can be used to improve software quality by exploiting CSEs. We present three example software development tasks that can be assisted by our life-cycle model and show how these three tasks can contribute to improve the software quality. We also show the application of our life-cycle model with a preliminary evaluation. © 2009 IEEE.

# 68 - Mining software history to improve software maintenance quality: A case study

## Tarvo A.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-58149512613&doi=10.1109%2fMS.2009.15&partnerID=40&md5=c43ea5eca7ea1dc04c0cf19037cdbb5e

To keep the Windows operating system stable and secure, Microsoft constantly updates it. However, any update can cause a software regression - an undesired change in the system's stable parts. A key technique for fighting regressions is thorough testing of all updates, which is costly. A statistical model that estimates the risk for updates on the basis of their characteristics makes testing more efficient. Training this model requires collecting data on a large number of fixes made in previous versions of Windows. The Binary Change Tracer tool gets this information from the disparate data sources. © 2009 IEEE.

# 69 - Using test case patterns to estimate software development and quality management cost

## Issa A.A., Abu Rub F.A., Thabata F.F.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-67650594947&doi=10.1007%2fs11219-009-9076-9&partnerID=40&md5=275e35298f34ea43b23576f2494bd244

A novel process to discover test case patterns is proposed. This has led to the construction of a test case patterns catalogue. The catalogue has been analysed to estimate the potential reusability in different software applications. This has shown that 43% of system functions are generally application domain independent, whereas 57% are application domain dependent. Statistical tests showed that the level of specialisation in software systems could be as low as 20%, which supports the direction taken in this research to reuse test case patterns in software engineering activities, in particular, software cost estimation at the early sages of software development. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

# 70 - Evaluating the service quality of software providers appraised in CMM/CMMI

## Dos Santos R.P., De Oliveira K.M., Da Silva W.P.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-67650588099&doi=10.1007%2fs11219-008-9065-4&partnerID=40&md5=a0c3543209fa0aeadaf109b943e64e27

Recently, several companies have decided to adopt maturity models such as the CMM/CMMI to ensure quality software processes. The state year report of the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) showed that more than three thousand CMMI appraisals have been conducted since 2002. Many of these were performed at software providers, i.e. companies that develop software for other companies. Although the costs of the implementation and appraisal of CMM/CMMI are high for the software providers, there is no formal study investigating whether this investment pays off or, in other words, whether their customers are measurably satisfied with the quality of the service provided. This article presents the results of a formal evaluation of customer perception of the service quality offered by the software providers appraised in CMM/CMMI. We developed an instrument based on a widely used service quality evaluation model (SERVQUAL) and applied this instrument to several customers of software providers appraised in CMM/CMMI. The results show a considerable discrepancy between customers' expectations and their perceptions of the services provided. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

# 71 - Software quality analysis by combining multiple projects and learners

## Khoshgoftaar T.M., Rebours P., Seliya N.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-65049088406&doi=10.1007%2fs11219-008-9058-3&partnerID=40&md5=06eba0a38d1ff8b43ab27b16cb75fa0e

When building software quality models, the approach often consists of training data mining learners on a single fit dataset. Typically, this fit dataset contains software metrics collected during a past release of the software project that we want to predict the quality of. In order to improve the predictive accuracy of such quality models, it is common practice to combine the predictive results of multiple learners to take advantage of their respective biases. Although multi-learner classifiers have been proven to be successful in some cases, the improvement is not always significant because the information in the fit dataset sometimes can be insufficient. We present an innovative method to build software quality models using majority voting to combine the predictions of multiple learners induced on multiple training datasets. To our knowledge, no previous study in software quality has attempted to take advantage of multiple software project data repositories which are generally spread across the organization. In a large scale empirical study involving seven real-world datasets and seventeen learners, we show that, on average, combining the predictions of one learner trained on multiple datasets significantly improves the predictive performance compared to one learner induced on a single fit dataset. We also demonstrate empirically that combining multiple learners trained on a single training dataset does not significantly improve the average predictive accuracy compared to the use of a single learner induced on a single fit dataset. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

# 72 - Should we try to measure software quality attributes directly?

## Moses J.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-64249172602&doi=10.1007%2fs11219-008-9071-6&partnerID=40&md5=0648b6d6e222796c2e98f7d73d843380

Most external software quality attributes are conceptually subjective. For example, maintainability is an external software quality attribute, and it is subjective because interpersonally agreed definitions for the attribute include the phrase 'the ease with which maintenance tasks can be performed'. Subjectivity clearly makes measurement of the attributes and validation of prediction systems for the attributes problematic. In fact, in spite of the definitions, few statistically valid attempts at determining the predictive capability of prediction systems for external quality attributes have been published. When validations have been attempted, one approach used is to ask experts to indicate if the values provided by the prediction system informally agree with the experts' intuition. These attempts are undertaken without determining, independently of the prediction system, whether the experts are capable of direct consistent measurement of the attribute. Hence, a statistically valid and unbiased estimate of the predictive capability of the prediction system cannot be obtained (because the experts' measurement process is not independent of the prediction system's values). In this paper, it is argued that the problem of subjective measurement of quality attributes should not be ignored if quality is to be introduced into software in a controlled way. Further, it is argued that direct measurement of quality attributes should be encouraged and that in fact such measurement can be quantified to establish consistency using an existing approach. However, the approach needs to be made more accessible to promote its use. In so doing, it would be possible to decide whether consistent independent estimates of the true values of software quality attributes can be assigned and prediction systems for quality attributes developed. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

# 74 - Continuous software quality supervision using source inventory and columbus

## Bakota T., Beszédes A., Ferenc R., Gyimóthy T.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-57349138856&doi=10.1145%2f1370175.1370193&partnerID=40&md5=da38b72dde1093c2ee7dba33829c5806

Several tools and methods for source code quality assurance based on static analysis finally reached a state when they are applicable in practice and recognized by the industry. However, most of these tools are used in an isolated manner and very rarely as organic parts of the quality assurance process. Furthermore, little or no help is provided in interpreting the outputs of these tools. This paper presents Source Inventory, a system for source code-based software quality assessment and monitoring, which is able to collect, store and present measurement data including metrics, coding problems and other kinds of data like bug numbers and test coverage information. It helps software developers, architects and managers to take control over their software's quality by performing continuous code scans, fault detection, coding style verification, architecture violation detection, and automatic report generation considering metric baselines.

# 75 - The influence of organizational structure on software quality: An empirical case study

## Nagappan N., Murphy B., Basili V.R.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-57049120016&doi=10.1145%2f1368088.1368160&partnerID=40&md5=19360123674f7d87fc739220624c0ad1

Often software systems are developed by organizations consisting of many teams of individuals working together. Brooks states in the Mythical Man Month book that product quality is strongly affected by organization structure. Unfortunately there has been little empirical evidence to date to substantiate this assertion. In this paper we present a metric scheme to quantify organizational complexity, in relation to the product development process to identify if the metrics impact failure-proneness. In our case study, the organizational metrics when applied to data from Windows Vista were statistically significant predictors of failure-proneness. The precision and recall measures for identifying failure-prone binaries, using the organizational metrics, was significantly higher than using traditional metrics like churn, complexity, coverage, dependencies, and pre-release bug measures that have been used to date to predict failure-proneness. Our results provide empirical evidence that the organizational metrics are related to, and are effective predictors of failure-proneness. Copyright 2008 ACM.

# 76 - Towards a generic model for software quality prediction

## Rana Z.A., Shamail S., Awais M.M.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-57149116564&doi=10.1145%2f1370099.1370108&partnerID=40&md5=a9ab5cf643251f0801b615aacac6c9e5

Various models and techniques have been proposed and applied in literature for software quality prediction. Specificity of each suggested model is one of the impediments in development of a generic model. A few models have been quality factor specific whereas others are software development paradigm specific. The models can even be company specific or domain specific. The amount of work done for software quality prediction compels the researchers to get benefit from the existing models and develop a relatively generic model. Development of a generic model will facilitate the quality managers by letting them focus on how to improve the quality instead of employing time on deciding which technique best suites their scenario. This paper suggests a generic model which takes software as input and predicts a quality factor value using existing models. This approach captures the specificity of existing models in various dimensions (like quality factor, software development paradigm, and software development life cycle phase etc.), and calculates quality factor value based on the model with higher accuracy. Application of the model has been discussed with the help of an example. Copyright 2008 ACM.

# 77 - Quality software development: What do we need to improve in the software development process?

## Verner J.M.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-57049187241&doi=10.1145%2f1370099.1370100&partnerID=40&md5=1bfb947e48d001fb3000933de021ef29

There are a number of authors who have documented problems with our software development processes. Unrealistic schedules and budgets, with continuing steams of requirements changes lead to projects with a high risk of failure. There is too often only a vague idea of the required solution at the outset of a project and this makes it difficult for estimators and developers. It is commonly accepted that there will be requirements changes throughout the project. This means that managing changes becomes a challenge. Most IT experts agree that failures occur far more often than they should. Most developments are expensive, with a difficult process affected by a series of problems including poor project management, cost and schedule overruns, poor quality software and under-motivated developers. Unfortunately few project post-mortems are conducted, and little understanding is gained from the results of past projects Most project failures are predictable and avoidable, but many project managers cannot identify what success and failure factors are important, early enough to take action. Many factors are described in the literature including project pressures with project stakeholders impacting the cost and quality of the project, organizational structure, communication with customer/users, and amongst customers, developers & users, stakeholder politics, commercial pressures, poor leadership, lack of upper management support and personality conflicts, unrealistic, unarticulated goals, poor user requirements and requirements specification, customer satisfaction; scheduling, project budget, and inaccurate estimates of resources, poor project management, poor reporting of project status, unmanaged risks, inability to handle project complexity, the project management process and tracking tools, sloppy development practices, software development methodologies, use of immature technology, product quality, business processes and resources. There are generally more than 1 or 2 reasons for a project failure which may be caused by a combination of technical, project management and business decisions. Most organizations do not see preventing failure as an urgent matter. Unfortunately, the literature on project failure is based on handful of failed project case studies. Our research is concerned with getting quantitative evidence on aspects contributing to failure. If we know what factors are responsible for failure we can focus on these factors and improve the quality of our development processes for future projects. We also should recognize effects of project failure on development staff. Late projects usually cause long hours of unpaid overtime, loss of motivation, and stress. This then leads to high staff turnover and its associated costs. This research provides an update on prior studies and tests the validity of previously reported anecdotal evidence about project failure factors. We build on previously reported research but our concern is with everyday projects, not the high profile projects normally reported in the newspapers. We collected a set of project data and teased it out to find the main failure factors for a whole group of projects. We first developed a questionnaire targeting software developers' perceptions of practices affecting project outcomes. Our questionnaire was based on extensive discussions with 90+ software developers as well as the literature. The survey included 88 questions organized into sections covering sponsor/senior management, customer/user, requirements, estimation and scheduling, the development process, the project manager and project management, and the development team. We also asked if the project was a success or a failure. The questionnaire was distributed to practitioners from a large U.S. financial institution where each responded by answering it twice. It was then distributed to various companies in North Eastern U.S.A., a number of different Australian companies; and a number of different Chilean organizations; each respondent in the latter groups answered the questionnaire once. We collected data on 304 projects, 70 were failures. Of the failed projects, 49 were in-house and 21 outsourced, 65 were development projects and 5 maintenance projects. The largest project that failed had 180 developers. We examined the data using frequency analyses and as well investigated relationships between the most important factors.

# 78 - Data sets and data quality in software engineering

## Liebchen G.A., Shepperd M.

OBJECTIVE - to assess the extent and types of techniques used to manage quality within software engineering data sets. We consider this a particularly interesting question in the context of initiatives to promote sharing and secondary analysis of data sets. METHOD - we perform a systematic review of available empirical software engineering studies. RESULTS - only 23 out of the many hundreds of studies assessed, explicitly considered data quality. CONCLUSIONS - first, the community needs to consider the quality and appropriateness of the data set being utilised; not all data sets are equal. Second, we need more research into means of identifying, and ideally repairing, noisy cases. Third, it should become routine to use sensitivity analysis to assess conclusion stability with respect to the assumptions that must be made concerning noise levels. Copyright 2008 ACM.

# 79 - Engineering models and software quality models: An example and a discussion

## Salvaneschi P., Piazzalunga U.

## https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79959190479&doi=10.1145%2f1370731.1370741&partnerID=40&md5=d2ce735f0f93bb485210c6ccb9125006

The paper compares the models used for software quality evaluation to the modelling approach of other engineering fields. The conclusion is that, while large efforts have been devoted to the definition of measurable attributes and related measures, product models specifically developed for measuring quality characteristics are until now not sufficiently explored. We explore the concept of "quality-oriented specialized product models" and we claim that this is an important ingredient for an engineering approach to the software quality measurement. We describe an example of this type of models for measuring the security of a specific type of copy protection mechanisms. The model forecasts the amount of time a hypothetical attacker would need to break the protection. Copyright 2008 ACM.
